and i\u2019m gonna tell you about how all this young boy ever wanted was happiness all he ever wanted was positivity all he ever wanted to do was entertain and this boy went through hell you gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy 'cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist like bitch, that don\u2019t make no sense, but it is what it is you know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger the kids at school callin' him a cracker identifying as black, looking as white being told what you can or can\u2019t be this kid went through everything he went through... he saw narcotics in the household violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped there was crazy shit that happened to this kid and he persevered while the whole world said what they said? said you wouldn\u2019t be shit! you ain\u2019t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing and i, and he, he said fuck that, i\u2019ma persevere and that\u2019s why the message is always peace, love and positivity see, he always saw things from two sides he always saw things from two sides he always knew that the message everybody was born equal regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation he knew that because he saw that (take it back, take it way back take it way) because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated and that did not know and he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know these people that are ignorant that cannot see the bigger picture that must fight and kill and murder each other but once again, all he ever wanted to do was spread a message of equality for every man, woman, and child regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation (take it back, take it way back take it way, way back to the first) now imagine this child growing up and seeing the craziest shit being a part of the craziest shit running around with the wrong people running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and, and all this because he didn\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t know! but he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn\u2019t right and he knew that he needed to get away from it now i want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old this child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings and then he would then come home to about eight or nine hours of sleep but spend four, five, six hours of that working on music, persevering grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror and pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people just chanting his name hoping that it would happen but the, but the, but the world said no! mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka no-no! (take it back, take it way back take it way, way back to the first) and he said fuck that he said peace, love, and positivity he said equality for all man regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah now i want you to also imagine people telling him that he did not live this life \u201cyou just a white boy you ain\u2019t never experienced that shit you from gaithersburg, maryland, nothing happens there oh no, no, we know, we weren\u2019t there we didn\u2019t live with you, we didn't live in your section 8 household we didn\u2019t live with the narcotics and violence in your household we just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside outside, outside, outside, outside and since you white, you gotta have money, right?\u201d (take it back, take it way back take it way, way back to the first black man) and this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was, wasn\u2019t, and would never be (take it back, take it way back take it way, way back to the first black) and that man is here today, proud a lover of all human beings regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah and he\u2019s here to say: even though we\u2019re all born and created equal we are not treated equally there\u2019s extremists on every side and you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe as long as they\u2019re not hurtin' anybody you can believe they\u2019re going to hell you can believe it\u2019s not right you can believe you\u2019re superior, fine just stop killing each other ",

i get a \"hell yeah\" from dre, lookin' boy i'ma work for everything i have, never ask nobody for shit get outta my face, lookin' boy! basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause\u2014 i'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god all my people from the front to the back nod, back nod the way i'm racin' around the track, call me nascar, nascar dale earnhardt of the trailer park, the white trash god kneel before general zod this planet's krypton\u2014no, asgard, asgard so you'll be thor and i'll be odin you rodent, i'm omnipotent let off, then i'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs, i'm totin' and i should not be woken i'm the walkin' dead, but i'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deep-throatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common, poodle i'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil it's me, my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case, 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on \"i'm back\" from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line, add an ak-47, a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was, but i'm morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal? fuck being normal! and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya, like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man, oh man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day, \"hey fab, i'ma kill you!\" lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (j.j. fad) uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman? innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music, you make elevator music \"oh, he's too mainstream.\" well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it \"it's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"\u2014'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock, shock rap with doc throw on \"lose yourself\" and make 'em lose it \"i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use.\" let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains, i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too? ugh, school flunky, pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself, but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you! i'm drunk, so, satan, take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz, still \"chunky but funky\" but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have, then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? make lemonade then! but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then? don't mistake him for satan; it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard! be a king? think not why be a king when you can be a god?

i'm just a fuckin' romantic i fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! combative, possessive, in fact last time i was mad at an ex i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events i said, \"hit the road\", then after she left i sent that bitch a text that said, \"be careful driving don't read this and have an accident\" she glanced to look at it and wrecked (*car crashes*) too bad, thought we had a connect no sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case than the model covered in l'or\u00e9al and mace who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin' while the whore was yellin', \"rape!\" 'til her vocal cords were swellin' and her voice were more hoarser than tori spellings' face still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates to greet norman bates with a warm embrace 'less you're andrea yates, don't ask me for a date though you're late, well, the sentiment's great but wait, think there's been a mistake you wanted an intimate date, i wanna intimidate i have infinite hate in my blood it's mainly 'cause of the game of\u2014 (*message sound*) wait, \"dinner at eight\"?

moved away from home to school with big plans by day, studied the history of music by night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance to get your pants was a mission impo\u2013ssible we were both the same age, but i suppose wasn't on the same page, but in the same book of life, so i'd page you when i felt you that were getting off of work or either when you're on your way to school we started hanging like ernie and bert and in my idle head i'm thinking, \"cool\" just when i think i'm going down your shirt you're hiking up your skirt now the events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be heaven or hell the angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best therefore hard to tell you'd dropped me off by the dungeon never came in, but i knew that you were wondering \"now are these niggas in this house up to something selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?\" w-w-w-well, yes and no yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow cook it in the basement then move it at a show then grab the microphone and everybody yelled, \"ho!\" meanwhile, the video starts playing bet, college radio, and a van packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand and one in their ear, you know what i'm saying but, i kept your number in my old phone got a new chip flip with the roam-roam so it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits but i promised i would call you when i got home but, when i got home, i never did by the time i did, heard that you had a kid by some nigga in decatur who replied, \"see you later\" when he got the good news; that's life, shit now, i'm nineteen with a cadillac my nigga had a lex with the gold pack got a plaque, but i'm living with my pop-pop so i got a glock and a lojack you kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw and never said much 'cause half of what he saw was so far from that place you wanna be that words only fucked it up more, follow me are you starting to gather what i'm getting at? now if i'm losing you, tell me, then i'll double back but keep in mind, at the time \"keep it real\" was the phrase silly once said now, but those were the days when spring break, and daytona, and freakniks made you wanna drop out of college and never go back move to the south, but that ain't a kodak moment, on went myself and big boi well, you knew him as 'twan that's right, you were around before this shit begun when 'twan had a daughter and sorta was made to mature before the first tour we hit the road like jack laughed and cried and drive it back with some yak girls used to say, \"y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?\" and i'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling \"no, i'm from atlanta, baby, he from savannah, maybe we should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey, we gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes\" she's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants 15-love, fit like glove description is like fifteen doves in a jacuzzi catching the holy ghost making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree? enough about me, how's about you? how's the lil' kid? she was about two the last time we spoke i hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink 'cause i'd start the second album off on another note now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off but see, i'd balled out, and 'fore i'd fall out i'd slow my lac down to a nice speed the brain was that fried egg i might need new direction was apparent i was a child looking at the floor, staring so changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast yes, i was on the rise, yeast was the street to make bread, never primary concern just to hop on these beats and wait my turn i'd meet muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas and macaroni niggas, imposters so on a trip to new york on some beeswax i get invited to a club where emcees at and on stage is a singer with some thing on her head similar to the turban that i covered up my dreads with which i was rocking at the time when i was going through them phases trying to find anything that seemed real in the world still searching, but i started liking this girl now you know her as erykah \"on and on\" badu call tyrone on the phone, \"why you do that girl like that, boy?
