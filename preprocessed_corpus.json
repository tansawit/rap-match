i should just rap as myself as a matter of fact and that\u2019s the reason i think scotty\u2019s wack cause he doesn\u2019t seem to have depth on his tracks and depth is all i seem to have left, cause so many sleepless nights all i\u2019ve done is wept and throw on some eminem and pretend that i don\u2019t wish my life would end and my friends aren\u2019t there so why do i even call them friends but in reality and honesty, i\u2019m probably a wannabe of possibly a prophecy cause constantly im commonly \u2026the one trying to live modestly when nobody else does most of the time i feel i\u2019m the kid nobody else loves and they say \u201coh frankie wow i love him\u201d in my head i say \u201cwhen was the last time you hugged him\u201d cause that\u2019s all i need to keep from breaking but it gives me something to write, music making cause kobe made 23 million in 2010 where as we got parents who won't see their kids again and yet as the same time that america sheds a tear ray rice is getting 9 mill a year cause he plays for the baltimore ravens yet we still have \u201cfood for the homeless foundations\u201d education isn\u2019t getting any funding yet we\u2019re surprised when our kids turn out like al bundy the fact of it is most people that rap like this talkin' about some shit they haven't lived surprise, you know the drill trapped in a box, declined record sales follow the formula violence, drugs, and, sex sells so we try to sound like someone else this is not californication there's no way to glorify this pavement and that\u2019s why i tell stories within all of my rhymes cause there\u2019s parts of me within all of these lines and i can bear my soul in each and every rap poem the depth of who i am i\u2019m trying to show them there\u2019s more to me than a half black kid who giggles i speak through rhymes which speak through riddles and to the haters i give these fingers in the middle the concept of what i try to say is so simple but in reality nobody really gives a fuck they want something to roll their windows down and turn their system up well screw it i\u2019m saying i\u2019ll rap how i wanna and be myself is what i am gonna ..do and its nothing new or fresh i\u2019d rather be hated for what i am then fake and the best the life i\u2019m fearing\u2026 seems more like the life i\u2019m nearing and they say to face your fears but they shouldn\u2019t be approaching\u2026 how did i i get stuck in this spot, where music is all i got and it\u2019s a lot but it\u2019s never enough and when it comes down to it i\u2019m trying to rap real stuff like the fact that the only that\u2019s going up is the debt and the amount of nationwide tragedies and death and the kids under the influence of herion and meth because a home life is something they never met i've seen my people's dreams die i've seen what they can be denied and \"weeds not a drug\" - that's denial groundhog day life repeat each time cheatin' and lyin' friendship cease, no peace in the mind stealin' and takin' anything to fix the pieces inside broken, hopeless, headed nowhere i come from a city where people have it so good that to add excitement to their life they try to act hood being rude to cops and taking so many shots that they are seeing spots by the time it\u2019s 12 o\u2019clock and then they are drinking and driving barley surviving but the thing that is oh so surprising is that they\u2019re doing well in school silly little fools, i know you\u2019re drinking just to seem cool and then the ones who are privledged are breaking all the rules yet still have the money to apply to 5 star schools did you know out of my graduating class 3 of the valedictorians had been caught straight passed out on the couch from drinking and the thing that i am thinking is that america is great i really truly love her but i\u2019m thinking she isn\u2019t really a mother more like a little sister or brother that takes everything they do wrong and cover it up, to the best of their luck cover up anything that happened when they run amuck, that\u2019s what\u2019s up you\u2019d rather here a dope beat and some lines about sex well listen to the other 900 rappers who claim that they\u2019re next thinkin' i would never do that, not that drug and growing up nobody ever does until your stuck, lookin' in the mirror like i can't believe what i've become swore i was goin' to be someone and growing up everyone always does we sell our dreams and our potential to escape through that buzz just keep me up, keep me up hollywood here we come ",

@childishgambino i guess \u201coldest computer\u201d mackelmore was supposed to be on it, but it became a little too house-y. then ms.banks came and made it a different song. it was cool to see i never feel like everything\u2019s done honestly urn @chitownguevara what are you doing right now? ;))) @childishgambino im hanging with notero (nicole) and eating sushi @mynamescody are there more doors opened or closed in the entire world at this moment? @childishgambino the problem is we see doors @brockemsockemz 1. what was your inspiration for flight of the navigator? 2. favorite collab with chance the rapper? @childishgambino i just felt really strange about death after seeing someone leave. i felt like it was a really cruel joke @skyart 1) what are you saying @2:23 on zealots\u2026 2) what is the meaning for some of the titles, like sweatpants @childishgambino i\u2019m saying \u201cwanna walk too?\u201d rich people wear whatever they want @clouds during what season did you record this album? spring? summer? fall? winter? did it have an effect on your songwriting/state of mind/et cetera? thnx @childishgambino i started christmas day of last year. we were recording on this mountain above weather, so we weren\u2019t cold unless we came down. i made it with winter in mind @streetlights - will you be my friend and can we eat osso buco together? - can you break down some of the beats on because the internet? - how much influence do you get from kanye west? @childishgambino i am def your friend if you\u2019re good with yourself and like to talk about stuff. notero loves my osso bucco @aknc17 sorry to get personal right away but people always ask basic ass questions in q and a\u2019s so here it goes i know you were raised jehovah\u2019s witness but do you still follow any type of religion? @childishgambino i don\u2019t really believe in religion for myself. i\u2019ve become spiritual, more at peace with things. but i don\u2019t believe in god. not like that @goochcrucible what website do you visit the most? @childishgambino rap genius @thedarkknight what was the meaning behind the title of \u201cclapping for the wrong reasons\u201d? @childishgambino its a semi famous quote @robertf donald, can you explain the greatness of sade\u2019s debut album \u201cdiamond life.\u201d i would appreciate a very detailed explanation of why sade is so great and what she means to you as an artist. if you refuse to answer this question i will take it to mean you do not enjoy the musical styling of sade\u2026.and as such you will draw my full ire -22 y.o male who has just gotten heavily into sade\u2019s music @childishgambino i was literally listening to sade yesterday. she\u2019s a world artist. and her music is just in tune with whatever vibration we all run on. i can\u2019t answer a lot of your questions about her, all i can say is she\u2019s a special artist/being @maxgertler what does the ending of the last song symbolize? like that life can end at any second randomly? @childishgambino you should read the \u2018because the internet\u2019 script when it\u2019s released @crookedmoderator if you could trade hairlines with another person, who would it be? @childishgambino they tell me i should fix my hairline cause i got money now i ain\u2019t gon sit around and front like i ain't thought about it a perfect hairline is more appealing but it\u2019s funny how my shit is fucked uppppppp but look how far i done got without it i keep my half of an octagon hairline fucked up just to show the kids it\u2019s real @kid_kamikazee what did your followers realize at the end of the biggest troll? @childishgambino they realize \u201cthey don\u2019t need a leader\u201d @fran-soul dude you are awesome love your music and my question is do you ever see your self touring africa? coz that\u2019s the only way i will ever see you unless you buy me a plane ticket to see you live in the us pliz respond @childishgambino i really wanna see africa. we were planning on south africa soon @wiggitywackwes 1. there were huge jumps style-wise and sonically from camp to royalty to because the internet, do you see yourself developing a \u201csignature sound\u201d or do you plan on keeping things experimental and constantly trying new sounds? 2. your music has helped me through a lot and continues to, so i just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for what you do. thank you! @childishgambino thanks i always wanna experiment. in everything. i\u2019ll always try to push myself. i just never wanna be bored @raybeach do you make things that have or message or do you just let people interpret it? kind of like 3005? @childishgambino i make things with messages for me in them. i hope they translate. sometimes they don\u2019t, and that\u2019s fine, but i usually just try to touch on something that\u2019s intangible for me @basedgator question part: what inspires you when it comes to production? i hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album, which make sense since your from the south, but you didn\u2019t really do that on camp. then you got something like \u2018zealots of stockholm\u2019 where it gets death grip-ish. is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things? since your probably not going to see/respond to this, let me stan a little bit haha stan part: you are my role model, i can identify with your life and lyrics so well it\u2019s crazy. i really hope in 10 years i can be as successful and well respected as you. i already liked your comedy and acting, but ever since i found out you rapped and i heard that e.e. cummings line in \u2018freaks and geeks\u2019 i was hooked. anyway, the new album is dope as heck, great work as always sir, and i can\u2019t wait to see what you do in the future @childishgambino ha. thanks i try not to think to hard about what\u2019s trap drums, what\u2019s influenced by who\u2019s hot now, and all that. i try to just find what feels honest. cause i don\u2019t know if i\u2019d wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone, but was no fun to make. this album, tho it came from a messy place, was by far the most fun to make @savvyrja it sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot? care to elaborate? @childishgambino to be honest, i don\u2019t know much about him. i was always a beach boys dude over beatles. i learned a little about him through jhene @savvyrja who is your favorite artist outside of hip-hop? perosnally, gorillaz or red hot chilli peppers @childishgambino anything by sam cooke @griffinmahon do you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to full-length movies? does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap? @childishgambino short films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we don\u2019t have a lot of time to spend. a short film, for me, leaves more to the audience, and doesn\u2019t take so much time. and if it\u2019s free, then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion @flowmatic whats your perspective on camp looking back at it now ? @childishgambino i love camp. it there\u2019s little things i\u2019d change, cause i know how music better, but yeah. i does what it\u2019s supposed to do @flytendencies how do you sing so beautifully? @childishgambino that\u2019s what you call it? @a1_day did my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and yeezus\u2019s sound play a role in because the internet? how big of a influence is kanye to you? @childishgambino i guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better? but honestly, his whole steez isn\u2019t for me. i can\u2019t do that. he just inspires me to be limitless @stefanponce can you break down the song to \u201cboy band\u201d ?!!!???!!!! @childishgambino @myh how can mirrors be real if our eyes aren\u2019t real? @childishgambino mirrors aren\u2019t real @metron what\u2019s the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life? did you explain the abrupt ending on life: the biggest troll? (i forgot to @ before cuz i was excited) @childishgambino i don\u2019t feel like i\u2019ve missed any opportunity, honestly @grizzycreekwater 3 questions : 1) favourite cartoon , what is your choice ? 2) would you ever do more stand-up shows or skits for youtube ? 3) favourite album in 2013 , from any genre ? @childishgambino i really like china, il. american dad has the best jokes. adventure time. regular show. amazing world of gumball @brockemsockemz if you were an animal, what would you be? @childishgambino koala @savvyrja who is your favorite philosopher? @childishgambino patrice o'neal and louis ck @darwin_shameran you have andrew auernheimer in your song, weev (andrew) is openly known as a racist and anti-semite, how come you decided to include him? @childishgambino video @eon2323 hey donald, big fan here (actually #1 gambino scholar here, but nbd). i have a couple of questions 1) do you have a whole bunch of those white shirts or is it the same one? 2) are you thinking about doing another comedy special in the near future? 3) what was your sister\u2019s reaction to your fame and come up in the rap game? 4) has chevy chase ever recited any of your lyrics or played any of your songs? thanks for just taking the time to read the questions. roscoes wetsuit @childishgambino first. thanks for doing all this work for me on rap genius 1) i have like 9 of these shirts 2) i honestly don\u2019t know 3) she\u2019s good with it. she\u2019s the best 4) no. i\u2019m positive he has never heard of childish gambino. i\u2019m pretty sure he thought i was eddie murphy the entire we were on set @akonomiles my question to you childish is what advice do you have for all the creatives out there that work so much on polishing their craft. that surround themselves with all types of shit, music, art, etc and try as much to absorb to than emit that knowledge into their work. what advice do you have childish cause sometimes i be feeling like im going nowhere. especially seeing others who do what i do get further than me when their ideas are really nothing but regurgetated shit we\u2019ve all seen. i just feel like im going crazy sometimes yo. haha. thanks \u2014 akono @childishgambino yeah. i think you have just look at what y o u really want. it can be frustrating. but u also have to know how people work and what people want from you you should read \u201cmastery\u201d by robert greene @childishgambino cool. i have some work to do thanks for the questions. rap genius is a dope place. cool to see you guys taking such good care of it happy leak day everyone kiss notero goodnight learn to code ",

            "lyrics": " this is the 10 year anniversary of the black album, and its really special for me, as i'm sure it is for a lot of people. i think everyone has an album or two that defines their musical taste, and sets the path for what you'll listen to in the future. you always have an emotional connection to the music you listened to in your high school years. its when we are the most passionate about our music choices. you didn't put your favorite passage from a book in your aim away message, you copied and pasted your favorite line from your favorite song growing up in a suburb in the 90's, i wasn't exposed to early hip hop like nwa and wu tang right away (don't worry, i caught up). all my friends listened to rock, whether it was green day, incubus, 311, stuff like that. and don't get me wrong, i love what the 90's represented for rock, its probably one of the strongest decades any genre ever had. but that also meant the only hip hop albums i had when i was 10, 11, 12 were big willie style and maybe the dangerous minds soundtrack. i just didn't know any better yet, call it youthful ignorance my mom used to literally sit me down and we'd listen to albums i bought front to back with the lyrics booklet out because she didn't want me having music with swears and drug references and all that. i hated it at the time, but you have to respect it now. so because of that, hip hop just wasn't an option for me until i got past that age, unless i snuck a cd into the house. my little brother and i used to borrow cds from our friends, and rip them to a cassette or my sony minidisc player. luda's word of mouf got confiscated from us multiple times because i was only listening to albums i was \"allowed\" to buy up to that point, i loved music, but never connected with it. it hadn't spoken to me yet, as far as me being able to relate what was going on in my life to the lyrics. now, i'm not trying to say i grew up the same way some of these hip hop artists did, because i didn't. i have an amazing family and my dad always provided for us, but i was frustrated by how little he was around at the time, and jay was talking about that specifically. songs like \"december 4th\" showed me that hip hop was about storytelling, whereas a lot of the pop music at the time was very bubble gum and generic. it felt so real, like putting on those headphones took you to a different place, and sometimes you need that kind of escape as a teenager the black album to me, aside from being probably one of the 2 or 3 greatest, if not the greatest hip hop albums, represents a time in my life where my personality was being shaped. everyone in high school is trying to figure out who they are, and music helps to define you, whether you like it or not. 10 years later, and \"psa\" is still the most played song in my itunes library. did i know what \"...i use to move snowflakes by the o-z\" meant at the time? probably not. but i knew every hov song front to back, and throughout the years, i'd hear a line and go \"ohhhh that's what he meant!\". hip hop was like watching a documentary to me, because it showed me how other kids lived in parts of the world i hadn't seen or experienced and opened my eyes and ears to other people's struggles, as well as successes the black album was a greatest hits collection in itself. i feel like people always downgrade newer albums in an artist's catalog, simply because \"their old stuff was better\". take a step back and isolate it, and you'll find it's an all time great. in his crwn interview with elliot wilson, hov's protege j. cole speaks on this infatuation with an artist's early work, and how you can never top your early work in the minds of your core, longtime fans because they feel a type of ownership of it. because they were the first out of their crew to listen to you as an artist, they will always hold the early stuff up on a pedestal. but jay wasn't the same person in 2003 that he was in 1996 when reasonable doubt came out. he had new problems, and new stories to tell. it was marketed as his last album, because he had said he was retiring after its release. this made you savor every minute of it. i felt like i was losing a friend, and wanted to make sure i soaked in every word, every line, so i would be satisfied at the end and could remember later in life how special it was it may not seem like it, but hip hop is still so young. we've seen so many changes happen in the culture in only a few decades, so its hard to compare different eras of hip hop. but we're the first generation that embraced hip hop fully. our parents don't completely understand it as a genre because they only hear the drug references, or the sometimes vulgar lines about women. they don't get past that because they grew up in a time where that kind of content wasn't commonplace. but because our generation is a little more desensitized to the language, we can listen to it and receive the message that the artist intended. do rappers objectify women and talk about drugs? yeah, sure. but so did the beatles, rolling stones, and hendrix. once you pull back that top layer, hip hop is what music has always been and always will be... a peek into someone's soul, in the hopes that you relate, connect, and use it as a guide to find your own way through life's ups and downs. and for me, if you had to ask me what singular album helped me through some of the best and worst times in my life, it was the black album happy anniversary hov \"no matter where you go, you are what you are player and you can try to change, but that's just the top layer man, you was who you was 'fore you got here only god can judge me, so i'm gone either love me, or leave me alone.\" ",

2pac \u2013 it\u2019s of my opinion that i was rapping while i was writing poetry.. police \u2013 okay 2pac \u2013 and so i was into rap, i guess you could say from junior high, when i wrote my first poems. and after i heard on the radio that there were other poets, who were making records and they were selling and it was working, that\u2019s when i decided to change the method of my poetry police \u2013 how do you define rap? what constitutes rap? 2pac \u2013 that\u2019s what it is to me: poetry. to me it\u2019s story-telling poetry police \u2013 to music, music with a beat? 2pac \u2013 with or without music you cannot define rap police \u2013 but it goes, it has sometimes a beat, a tune to it, doesn\u2019t it, even if it hasn\u2019t got accompaniment to it? 2pac \u2013 no, even a pentameter is rap. it\u2019s how you write it, the structure, it depends how you write it, and as to whether it has a beat, i guess it won\u2019t sell as much if you don\u2019t have a beat; the beat is more of a selling tool police \u2013 now, you were performing by the time you did your solo-album what people call \u201cgangsta rap\u201d., 2pac \u2013 no police \u2013 you were not?

like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever oh my atom: so what now? what advice can you give me? god: what advice can i give humanity? atom: i suppose so god: live your life. don\u2019t waste your days on the negative energy of others. remember that you\u2019re not your salary. you\u2019re not your house. you\u2019re not your car. and no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else\u2019s. so enjoy the days you have. worry not about the days that came before you. nor the ones that will follow you in death. remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. so live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all kai: damn man, we\u2019ve been walking forever thomas: well, thalias tracking system says we\u2019ll be there in just over an hour kai: shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it? thomas: oh no, man. i\u2019m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one one, two, three, four one, two, three, four, listen look into my eyes tell me you could see beyond the smile that i'm puttin' on this front that i'm puttin' up for you i spill my soul into a microphone with poems written in blood in hopes that it's enough for you do you love me yet? do you love me yet? no? okay i'll go harder for you in fact, i rap till i collapse all i wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson i'll never feel your approval till i accept my own come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed about the ways to raise a child up to not become a product of his environment, i need to cry and vent but i done built this wall up actin' like everything's all good but in reality i'm lookin' for something through bumpin' my favorite rappers i came up after nas, cole, and hov eyes closed, i zone till five or so in the morn' i'm used to being alone shit, you know how long i've been out on my own? chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne one day i wake up and see that it didn't exist all along till then i will pen verses that fans consider brilliant boosting my ego with every million that spills in and still then i won't find solace, so where's the logic in that? worrying 'bout if they think logic can rap when it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved by parents that was in too deep with the drugs nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit be who you are, identify as a star no one tells you you're that it's something that you just know the world be stealing your glow your mama did what she could her life was miles from good your father fell in the trap they set for you when you black they met when they was low and therefore you a product of that and so your trauma is deep don't bury it you should weep and clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em just my opinion, only then can you find peace just start to notice happiness don't come from album release i've been through it before can only share with you what i know to be true, but at the same time, i'll never be you and you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try this is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly the truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky but if you want to then you ought to know why are you running from something with hopes of becoming someone that's finally worthy of love let me tell you now, you're worthy enough fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell find god, learn to accept yourself and i'm gone, acceptance ",

            "lyrics": " jimmy kimmel: my guest tonight is a 21-time grammy award winning performer, who last month threatened his very existence by threatening one of america's most beloved television personalities. we had a big dumb fight on twitter, but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight. please welcome kanye west! jk: how are you? kanye west: i'm okay. jk: i'm very happy that you came. i'm glad you did, and i wanted to clear this up. i really felt bad about all this stuff. i did. kw: mm-hmm. jk: i guess the first question i should ask is, who are you wearing? kw: it's ralph. jk: kramden? lauren? jk: is that a new grill you have there? kw: nah they've been in my mouth for three years. jk: that one on the bottom? ok well it's good to see you. kw: good seeing you too. jk: i guess we should talk about what happened, because i do think that somewhere in you, you want people to understand where you\u2019re coming from is that true? kw: yeah, correct. jk: so we did a sketch on the show where we had - you did an interview with the bbc radio and it was an intense interview - and i\u2019ll be honest with you, i only saw a couple of little parts of the interview when we did this sketch. kw: yeah, that\u2019s what i thought. jk: in fairness, there was context to it and we took it out of context. and we had a couple of little kids reenact it. which i didn\u2019t think would be something that bothered you. do you mind if we show a little clip of it? little kanye: i've reached a point in my life where my truman show boat has hit the painting. i'm not trying to regurgitate myself. i'm a product person: not just clothing, but water bottle design, architecture, anything you could think about! brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to fendi, and they said no! how many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants?! jk: i'm gonna tell you something, the truth is the main reason i did that is because i like to see kids curse. i think it\u2019s funny. (*kanye laughs*) and i think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child, but that\u2019s not true. in fact, we\u2019ve done this to other people, with lady gaga, with quite a few people that we've had kids say what they said and reenact them. of course this is not something you knew. and this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew. and you called me. a lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and i cooked up. but this isn't, right? kw: i mean everyone out there in tv world, real world, whatever world you stay in, needs to know that i\u2019ve never done a publicity stunt in my life. any time i went up and spoke my mind, whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said, it was always what i thought was the truth. whether i'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever i felt emotionally. i don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say. so i don\u2019t do publicity stunts, period. so don\u2019t ever think that. jk: me neither guys. (laughter) so we talked on the phone, and i didn\u2019t really know why you were calling. i heard you were upset. but i didn't know the context, and we had a bad conversation, right? kw: yeah, i knew you before. and i saw you at a wedding and i remember you telling me, i want people to know this side of you and different things like this and i saw this good guy at the wedding. so when i saw the skit - which i didn't watch all the way through because i didn't want to be infuriated - i was like i know you. so it was a combination of me knowing you, but also me not knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of in touch. and me not knowing this person. so i was like this is the one person i know. so i can go and let out everything that i feel about every single bogus weekly cover, every skit, every single rumor in barber shops, everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what they're saying is not serious, or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious. and you know, it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men\u2026 that elevates sometimes, you take a guy, jimmy does his thing. and i do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute. jk: and i got beat up a lot in high school, so i didn't wanna go back to high school. jk: and this is something that to be honest with everyone, this is something that when you're with another celebrity we complain about. this zoo animal, it's a perfect thing, because people online they just want you to click through so they'll put whatever they can put as a headline to get you to click through and it can be damaging and i think people look at you and they go, \"this is a guy who\u2019s got millions of dollars, he's got a beautiful wife and a new baby, we can\u2019t possibly hurt this guy.\" and to be honest, even though i\u2019m in that same position too - i don't have a baby - it\u2019s not something that comes to my mind when i\u2019m cooking up a comedy sketch. and some of these things are hurtful, and the truth is important. and it's... but on the other hand, i will say a lot of times you i think you bring it on yourself, this kind of misunderstanding about you. i personally found it odd to be in the position that i was in because i often\u2026 i don\u2019t know if you know this, a lot of people think you\u2019re a jerk. and i often, in my own personal conversations, say, no, i know this guy, he is not a jerk. in fact i think we have a picture which i happened to see on my dad's ipad at the wedding and it's you and my dad - who you may have though was wolf blitzer in fairness - but i mean to go to a wedding of a friend of mine and you took a southwest airlines flight to that wedding just to make it for this guy who was just a coworker and then to be so nice to everyone there, that tells me a lot about you. everyone's nice to me when they meet me because they know i have a talk show and almost everyone's on their best behavior. but what i observe is how celebrities behave around other people - how they treat our staff and how they treat in this case my family, and i\u2019ve always said that to people about you. and i think that's important for... i know part of you doesn\u2019t care, i see you onstage saying, \"i don\u2019t want to hold your baby, i\u2019ll drop your baby on it\u2019s head\u2026\" you know i don\u2019t believe any of that stuff when you say it. kw: i\u2019m not running for office, i\u2019m just here to make good music, make people feel good when they hear my music. and you know when i did that interview, i was really vocal about a lot of things that i've been dealing with over the past 10 years, when i was put in the classification of \u201cjust a celebrity.\u201d because you know for me, i\u2019m a creative genius and there\u2019s no other way to word it. i know you\u2019re not supposed to say that about yourself, and i say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and i wanna bring more things to the world, i want to help the world. i want to make peoples\u2019 lives easier. i spent 2 of my checks in telemarketing when i was 18 years old on a pair of gucci slippers, and this is before there was h&m and zara, you couldn\u2019t just find cool stuff when you were growing up. and for me, i care about cool stuff. it means something to me, it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me, and that\u2019s what i was talking about on the zane interview. so when i come on here, i can laugh and i can joke, and i can see a skit and we can say, ok we love kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever, but for me, it\u2019s bigger than who i am and my presence, living. it\u2019s about when i was on earth what did i do to help? and at what point did i hit a glass ceiling where people said you\u2019re a celebrity so you can\u2019t help in this box, you can\u2019t help in this box. but i talked to quincy jones at john legend\u2019s wedding, and you do music, you can do anything. once you learn how to produce, you\u2019re a producer, you understand textures and colors. i have an art background even before i was a musician. people told me i couldn\u2019t rap. people had all this advice for me about how i shouldn't try to rap. and i wouldn\u2019t even say i\u2019m a rapper, i\u2019m more of a messenger than a rapper. so even when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it, and keeps re-contexting what i said. whereas if you look at the zane interview, it\u2019s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do. because most people just like bow down to tv or bow down to these cameras. like i could care less about any of these cameras, all i care about is my family, i care about protecting my girl, protecting my baby, and protecting my ideas and my dreams. and ya know that's the reason why i went so crazy. jk: i wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you\u2019re a genius that upsets people, but the truth is a lot people think they\u2019re geniuses, and nobody says it because it\u2019s weird to say it, but it is most certainly more honest to say \"i am a genius\"\u2026 kw: i\u2019m totally weird, and i\u2019m totally honest, and i\u2019m totally inappropriate sometimes. and the thing is for me to say i wasn\u2019t a genius, i would just be lying to you and to myself. jk: that's true, it\u2019s false humility. kw: oh my god. it comes with your first ticket to la, soon as you get off the plane, here\u2019s your false humility. maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the walk of fame one day for kissing everybody's ass. but it's like that's not what we're doing. by the way, i want to shoutout the walk of fame, because they said something like they\u2019re not gonna put my girl on the walk of fame because she\u2019s a reality star. it's like people are so so dated and not modern. there\u2019s no way a kim kardashian shouldn\u2019t have a star on the walk of fame. its ridiculous old concepts. and you know for me, i\u2019m just gonna give y\u2019all the truth. it\u2019s like my grandfather loved ali until he died, and my grandmother hated ali \u2019til she passed. so you\u2019re gonna love me or you\u2019re gonna hate me, but i\u2019m gonna be me. jk: alright, kanye west is here, more with kanye when we come back. announcer: the best tweets of kanye west. josh groban: can we please toast to the motherfuckin' douchebags tonight? do you know where to find marble conference tables? looking to have a conference... not until i get the table though. at most his tweets are 140 characters, but the depth of his passion is immeasurable. fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on. man... what ever happened to my antique fish tank? announcer: you'll get all of your favorites josh groban: classical music is tight yo. i make awesome decisions in bike stores. french fries are the devil. black is the new black. announcer: and many many more. josh groban's the best tweets of kanye west includes 752 original songs on 48 cds. josh groban: i love me!!!!!!!!!!!!! announcer: in stores now.

            "lyrics": " so now, that was funny, right? i imagine the skit was probably funny too. it wasn\u2019t that funny, to be honest with you. it was a five, i\u2019d give it. so i do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because i just want to be clear--bring up that...yeah, that--do you really think i look like spongebob? it\u2019s the first thing that came to my mind. where were you when you were writing those tweets. i like to imagine, on the toilet. yeah, that\u2019s when i think of the best shit. i was just at my place here, my old home here in la. as we were writing it, there was a frustration i was getting out, but also they were really funny to me as i was writing it, and i just thought it was so amazing that i was saying this in real time, in real life. you know, with my position, people are so scared to say anything, you know, as soon as you\u2019re a celebrity, you\u2019re not to say anything anymore. but just to completely wild out\u2026 the only reason i could do that is because we could speak on a similar level, and we can go back and forth. it was a crazy thing, to see that happen, as far as just the technology, and all of a sudden, everyone in the country knew you and i were having a really dumb fight. i just thought that that was amazing, to crack media, in a way. you know, i feel that media does everything they can to break creatives, to break artists, to break people\u2019s spirits, and i do everything i can to break media. from my standpoint, sometimes i\u2019ll think of things and maybe it\u2019s two o\u2019clock in the morning on saturday night, and my wife will go, \u201cdon\u2019t tweet that. do not tweet that.\u201d because people take things out of context, but you just do it, you don\u2019t care. you shoulda saw the second set of tweets\u2026 save them for next time. i do just want to say congratulations on your new baby. in fact, i brought you a little gift. i made fun of this, but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants, and there\u2019s some tiny little leather jogging pants fashion isn\u2019t always practical. it\u2019s more about emotion, it\u2019s more about swag. it\u2019s more about, you know, pussy. it\u2019s more about, like, club. it\u2019s more about style and stuff. i remember me and my boy virgil, that created the line pyrex vision. we sat as interns at fendi like six years ago. we had cue cards and everything, and the leather jogging pants is one of the things we presented that didn\u2019t go through, and the reason i brought that up in the zane interview is because there are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants. it became a phenomenon over the past three years. and it was to say, you know, i would sit with hedi slimane, who\u2019s now the head designer of saint laurent, and he\u2019d say, \u201cstop giving these big brands your ideas and everything.\u201d and it would just be like, what i was trying to express in the zane interview was, like, me--i know i\u2019m hip hop, and a rapper and everything--but i\u2019ve got ideas that mean something if i could put the proper production around them. so when do a nike yeezy or a louis vuitton shoe, the production around it was at the same level as the production on my cd, or when me and rick rubin or mike dean of whoever are working together. but if i go out and make my own t-shirt or something, and i call it \u201ckanye,\u201d everybody\u2019s gonna think about when i just called myself a creative genius, and say \u201cwhat\u2019s so genius about this?\u201d but when people line up for the yeezy, they\u2019re like, \u201coh, wow, this is like really genius.\u201d you need that production. but currently in fashion and the way the fashion world works, there\u2019s no black guy at the end of the runway in paris, in all honesty. and that\u2019s what i was talking about when the truman show hit the boat. what about a steve harvey collection? yeah, no. there\u2019s no steve harvey collection. no extra buttons on jackets or anything like that. but for michael jackson, michael jackson had to fight to get his videos on mtv because he was considered to be \u201curban.\u201d this is michael jackson. that\u2019s true. he was considered a black artist and was not right for mtv at that time. yeah, a black artist. so, for me, think about this: when i\u2019m in paris and i\u2019m sitting in fashion week for nine years, and south park makes fun of our outfits and all this, or people don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re there, i\u2019m getting called names. like stuff you can\u2019t even say on tv. and i still can\u2019t break that wall down. at a certain point, it\u2019s like, michael jackson trying to get his videos on because, who do you know who\u2019s known more for clothes than me? to not be able to do and produce to the highest level, and to have a meeting with everyone. i\u2019m talking about andrew rosen of theory, this guy over here, this guy who runs this company, leanne . these are the real people who produce the clothes that are on your back. zara, out there with ortega, francois pinault, everyone. and everyone just sort of looks at you like you\u2019re crazy and like you don\u2019t crash the internet. and you\u2019re just like, \u201chow can you get a shot?\u201d and then you try to do it on your own, and like, real designers will work for a rapper, and you just cannot overcome it. i mean, my grandfather drove the first cars in the marches just to get clean water, and one of the parallels i wanted to do for you is, like, richard pryor used to always talk about, he just wanted a clean plate. he just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate. so if i do an interview in w magazine, right, and they take all these classist shots at me because--it\u2019s not about racism anymore; it\u2019s classism, that\u2019s what i talked about. paula deen, she was old-school with it. they\u2019re like, \u201cwe don\u2019t do it like that anymore, paula deen. we\u2019re classist now.\u201d so this classism is what they do to try to say, \u201cyou\u2019re a rapper,\u201d or \u201cyour girl\u2019s on a reality show. you\u2019re not up here with us. you know, we\u2019re old money, we-- it\u2019s snobbery-- it\u2019s snobbery. and i\u2019m not into all that snobbery. because, you know what? we have the loudest voice, we have the loudest communication, and all we want to do is make awesome stuff. all we want is a real shot. not: ok, i\u2019m a celebrity, so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t-shirt. no, i understand about quality. i understand about fabrics. i spent ten thousand hours at this. i\u2019ve dedicated my life to this. and a lot of people say, \u201cok, you have to do music.\u201d i\u2019m gonna keep doing music, but what if people told me i couldn\u2019t rap, what woulda happened? what if people told me i couldn\u2019t perform. i\u2019m only 36 years old; i have other goals and other things. and i\u2019m gonna use my platform, every platform, to stand up and say, \u201ci want to make something, i want to make the next ralph lauren.\u201d that was the point of the zane interview, to say, people don\u2019t stand up to protect their dreams. people are too scared of getting, you know, spoofed in a way. and the irony of it is, think about a creative person in school. when you picture them, you\u2019re probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up, and i\u2019m the one creative, and this is the reason why i did this, because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life, and there\u2019s moments when i stood up to drug dealers in chicago and said, \u201cyou can\u2019t have my publishing. come and kill me. do whatever you\u2019re gonna do, but you\u2019re not going to bully me, you\u2019re not gonna stop me, because my mother made me believe in myself.\u201d no matter how many people tell me, \u201cstop believing in yourself! stop seeing what you can do! stop affirming what you\u2019re gonna do and then completing that in real life.\u201d that\u2019s the improper way to do it. i refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way they control people with low self-esteem. with improper information, with branding, with marketing\u2026 i refuse to follow those rules. it\u2019s about truth, it\u2019s about information, it\u2019s about awesomeness, and the only luxury is time. the time you spend with your family, that\u2019s the only luxury. so this concept of \u201cluxury\u201d is improper to me. you know, with nike, with apple, you remember there was phones that cost 4,000 dollars?! somebody pull out a vertu phone right now, you look ridiculous, but there\u2019s people who still spend five-thousand dollars on this bag, ten-thousand dollars on this to say, \u201coh, we\u2019re better than you.\u201d i mean, taste, culture, art, you know, just the quality of your life. this is what i\u2019m here to do, so when i compare myself to steve jobs or walt disney, howard hughes, david stern, michelangelo, da vinci, jesus of whatever it is, i\u2019m saying, \u201cthese are my heroes. these are people i look up to. this is the type of impact i want to make on the earth.\u201d if i can make this type of impact up to this point, what can i do, if you call bob iger and say, \u201cyo, give him a shot.\u201d if you call oprah and say, \u201cyo, back this kid. this kid, his parents were educators. he wants to educate. he wants to look at curriculums and say, \u2018how do we simplify that?\u2019\u201d exactly what i did in music, i want to apply to product, i want to apply to education. this is what my company donda is about. i could rap all i want, but without that roc-a-fella chain, and damon giving me that roc-a-fella chain. i don\u2019t care how beats i sold to whoever, i couldn\u2019t have made it to the point to make \u201cjesus walks.\u201d and now, even as a celebrity, i\u2019ve reached a ceiling. and the way paparazzi talk to me and my family is disrespectful, also. we bring something of joy to the world. when people hear my music they have a good time. and i should be respected as such when i walk down the street. don\u2019t ask me a question about something you say in a tabloid. don\u2019t try to antagonize me. cause, you know what, it\u2019s not safe for you in this zoo. never think that i\u2019m not from chicago for one second. and think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my family constantly. and people say, \u201cwell, you signed up to be a celebrity, blah blah blah\u2026\u201d it\u2019s like, you know what, and i understand paparazzi, you gotta get your money, it\u2019s hard out here, but let\u2019s have respect for each other. you do help me get money, paparazzi, you show people how fresh my outfit is, that helps me influence people. but when they show up at your house in the middle of the night, and your wife and your daughter are there, there\u2019s no human decency there. it\u2019s a lack of decency. kanye west, everybody.

            "lyrics": " zane lowe: grab a seat, grab a seat. so, you remember this place? graduation? i was also thinking about some of the other things we've done as well with the bbc, like abbey road sprung to mind with the strings. kanye west: oh yeah. that was good. that suit was like, i would've worn something different if i could look back right now. i could still do a suit, i just wouldn't have done that exact lapel situation. zl: but talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. that was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective. what are your thoughts when you think back about abbey road, where...it's just nuts. kw: i thought it was good. i thought it was what i was supposed to do at that time. if i see something, if i see an opportunity, i'm gonna go for it. we're all gonna die one day. zl: yeah, that's true. kw: so live like that. live like you could die tomorrow. go for it. those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far. zl: and you have, man, and you're here. six original albums of your own, a throne record, various records with g.o.o.d. music to talk about. but seriously, man, yeezus. bravo, dude. i mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre i've heard in a very, very long time, and just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, i think. kw: oh, thank you very much. yeah, i feel i was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. cause, you know, cruel summer is definitely kanye west, and there's something weird and kind of off about \"mercy,\" like when it has the high-pitched (impersonates noise), that type of sound. it sounds like art still a little bit, even though it obviously was a radio smash. but when i get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, it's like i'm speaking with today's textures. if you look at it 200 years from now, it's not going to stand out in the way that 808s or yeezus stands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, hey, i completely hate that, or i completely love that, but let me just think differently. because everybody is bound to these -- no pun intended -- they're bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and the normal radio thing. i was talking to frank ocean about this, and said, my mom got arrested for the sit-ins, and now we're more like the sit-outs. like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to us. we need to find something new, because it's being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way, that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something that's very formulaic. zl: so it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? having the peoples' ear, having peoples' attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if i'm not challenging them enough, i'm not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am i doing? kw: yeah. i'm not trying to regurgitate myself. i showed people that i understand how to make perfect. dark fantasy could be considered to be perfect. i know how to make perfect. but that's not what i'm here to do. i'm here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, sonically and society, culturally. zl: you've done that with yeezus. it's fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when i talk to artists about records of this nature, it's in the lead-up to something. so we're all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what i mean? you could tell me what you think of the record, but i'm trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won't have heard it. in this case, it's been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. you've seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. but i'm fascinated to know, today, how you would describe yeezus, as someone who made it. how you would describe that record. kw: i just think that i'm a production person, i'm a product guy, i'm a producer. so if i'm working on a john legend album, i'm gonna try to give john legend the best home for him to stay in. and i'm gonna try to push pusha t -- no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me -- to make the thing that represents what i like about his music the most. and then for me as kanye west, i gotta fuck shit up. zl: and you did, dude, seriously. from the minute it starts. i mean, seriously. (plays opening to \"on sight\"). it's disgusting. so you're up in the loft probably at this point, and you're kicking around ideas, and you're putting things together, and this sound comes into your head, and you're like, this is what i'm looking for? kw: nah. this is me going to the studio with thomas and guy-manuel, who's daft punk. they had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. this is just one session right here. this beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and i ended up making that the intro. zl: you know, i got a beef with you over this track. it's too short! i wanted more out of it. cause it's one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you're just getting warmed up. was that kind of deliberate, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we're going to get on with the album now? kw: nah, it's just what i felt, like it should be. zl: just a dance thing. kw: and you know, originally \"blood on the leaves\" was supposed to be first. zl: wow. kw: which, psychologically, i know would have changed certain yeezus naysayers about the album. it wasn't that time for me. i didn't want to come up there and perform. a lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. but i wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music. you know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine? it's in that territory. but i wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. it's the only place where i actually have a deal, so i can only consistently make things in music. so i'm gonna take music and i'm gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like on star wars and the hologram'll pop up out of r2d2. i'm gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way. whether it's, i'm going into a scream in the middle of the track because that's just the way i feel. but i'm not here to make easy listening, easy programmable music. zl: no. you're so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you don't rely on conventional rhyming flows. your opening line, \"yeezus season approaching,\" you know? \"a monster's awoken.\" you're laying it out there, this isn't my beautiful dark twisted fantasy part 2. i'm wilding out on this record, straight away. (plays interlude from \"on sight\"). and then from nowhere as well, we just get treated to these wonderful moments where, like you say, it's almost like a collage. like you're sitting here going, you know, why can't i go into this? why not? kw: you can. zl: and you did. kw: that's how life is. it's like a car crash. you could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens. zl: at what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record? kw: well, i didn't reduce it. rick rubin reduced it. he's not a producer, he's a reducer. (laughs). zl: but was it always part of the process for you, to say, why don't i take elements of this and this and just (claps hands together) bolt it together? kw: yeah. it's just the way i was consuming information in my life at the time. negative information to positive information, from the internet, just going to the louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews like this, learning more about architecture. taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. getting no headway whatsoever. it was just that level of frustration. this is what frustration fucking sounds like. this is what frustration sounds like. for me, as kanye west, i would not be kanye west if it wasn't for michael jackson. i was with quincy jones a couple days ago at john legend's wedding. quincy was telling me, it wasn't just mike, but these guys broke down the barriers. of course you know michael jackson, he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. this is michael jackson. michael jackson's not even black, he's michael jackson -- you know what i mean? he's so crazy, how can he even be classified as this black artist? so for me, in my life and creativity it's been challenging and everything. but i was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights, what michael jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. there would be no kanye west if it wasn't for michael jackson - that allowed him to be that, right? now let's take people who have issues with me as kanye west. they classify my motivational speeches as rants - like \"why is he saying that? why is he doing that?\" well i've reached a point in my life where my truman show boat has hit the painting. and i've got to a point that michael jackson did not break down. i have reached the glass ceiling - as a creative person, as a celebrity. when i say that it means i want to do product. i am a product person. not just clothing but water bottle design, architecture, everything that you could think about. and i've been at it for 10 years, and i look around and i say, \"hey wait a second - there's no one around here in this space that looks like me.\" and if they are, they're quiet as fuck! so that means - wait a second - now we're seriously in a civil rights movement. like people used to joke about - remember our south park photo - remember how funny that was? do you think there would be a givenchy in the hood if it wasn't for that south park photo. but no one thinks about that - no one thinks about the names i got called for wearing tight jeans. zl: you reference that in the record, you talk about that. \"no one's liked him since he's been wearing tight jeans.\" everybody knows you brought back real rap. i mean you reference that in the record. kw: i'm saying y'all had all that, but i brought real rap back. i'm going to do dope things. and i wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because i go to hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things that're coming out. and every time my name goes up, there's a series of people who write just negative comments - they wanna joke around and say, \"why is he still trying? why is he doing this?\" they like diss me as a person for trying. now mind you, i've brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity. and now, what they don't realize when i say \"hey this is pusha t, this is what it is\" i have to remind pusha t that he's pusha t. because the radio, if they're not playing a song of his that has an r&b hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs, it's like we forget about that clipse album that meant everything. and the reason why i relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that's the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design - we looked at clipse as the gods, and this is our soundtrack to creativity. and it's not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity. no knock to trap, cause i did \"can't tell me nothing\" - i like it. but it's been commercialized to the point where - and i'm not mentioning no names - but people used to use the term \"r&b nigga\" but then it was \"rappers.\" but then rappers didn't wanna be no r&b nigga. now the rappers is the new r&b niggas! the rapper's the new radio! like where's the culture at? where is the culture at? so then i scream - and i'm sitting in the middle of it - whether i'm at a dinner with anna wintour, or i'm at a listening session with pusha, or me and virgil are in rome giving designs to fendi over and over and gettin' our designs knocked down. brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to fendi, and they said no. how many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant? meaning when i see hedi slimane and it's all like, \"ok this is my take on the world\" - yeah he got some nice $5,000 jeans in there, some nice ones here and there, some good shit here and there. but we culture. rap the new rock n' roll! we culture! rap is the new rock n' roll! we the rock stars! zl: it's been like that now for a minute. kw: it's been like that for a minute, hedi slimane! it's been like that for a minute. we the real rock stars, and i'm the biggest of all of 'em. i'm the number one rock star on the planet. click here for part 2 ",

            "lyrics": " kanye west: we the real rockstars and i'm the biggest of all of them. i'm the biggest rock star on the planet. zane lowe: there it is. that record- it says that. that's what your album says when you come out, and there are songs on there where you make it very clear. kw: so what i want to explain to everybody out there, it's like, i make music i can do it, but i shouldn't be limited to only one place of creativity. and it's literally only like one of two reason why i haven't been able to break that down. zl: but why should you feel that you are? because- kw: no! this is the thing you guys don't understand. you guys don't understand. you guys don't understand that i did the yeezys and they ebay'd for 90 thousand dollars and people wanted them bad as whatever, right? but i didn't get a call from nike the next day. you guys don't understand that i've met with companies and they say, \"what we're trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that\". if you're an architect and you're a world builder and you have all these ideas and you're gaudi, and you want to build buildings, if you don't ever get that out, what's gonna happen? zl: isn't that why you do it? isn't it the process? isn't it point to do it? kw: i don't think you're really hearing what i'm saying. zl: i'm trying to kw: as a creative, for you to have done something to the level of the yeezys and not be able to create more and you cannot- you cannot create that on your own, with no support, with no backing. so when i say \"clean water was only served to the fairer skinned\" what i'm saying is we're making products with chitlins. t-shirts! that's the most we can make! t-shirts. we could have our best perspective on t-shirts. but if it's anything else... *hand smack* your truman show boat is hitting the wall. and what's more important to me about this than everything i can do sonically and everything is, if i go somewhere else and someone says, \"hey, we don't like kanye west\" you've heard that before, right? what people don't realize is i want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through brand yeezy. i want to make that one step, and then make another step, and eventually do uniforms for the entire city, then i want those uniforms to be hot and make money, then i eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after i make that billion dollar step, then i can go in and say i have an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step, i eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company. but when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovate take on theatre because you thought of it one night when you were sitting on top of watch the throne set which you designed with es devlin, and i designed the set with es devlin and thought of, \"ok, surround vision, there should be a screen above you, below you, to the left, to the right of you and one in front of you also\" then i paid my own money that i get paid for doing gold digger, which i never really liked that song but i always knew i would get paid for doing gold digger, then i shoot a film in qatar with three camera crews, with nate brown, virgil, matt williams, nabil, all of these crew- all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on hypebeast thats my crew, right? so, we go out and shoot that, 3 camera crews over 5 days edited over 30 days, show it at amfar- no, show it in cannes, the night before amfar on the beach, build it in a pyramid with rem koolhaas' agency, design the entire thing, put editors in it, blah blah blah, people give a standing ovation, i do an interview in new york times the next year to say, \"hey, i did this and i want to let you know i did it\", right? and then, it doesn't get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with george lucas and steven spielberg and they're talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it'll be higher priced tickets and it'll be something that's surrounding you and blah blah blah, maybe it's in the goggles, i said, \"wait a second, i just only did the interview to tell people that i invented it. i made it.\" like i went, i remember when i was, uh, dropping william morris, right, and then sarah newkirk at that time said \"before you drop them, go meet with ari emanuel\" and i sat with him and i said, \"ari, i'm an inventor\" and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said was \"you are a celebrity. so basically what's going to happen is, there's product here, and this is where you end up, right here. if you can communicate the product you can make money of the product, cause look at gaga. she's the creative director of polaroid.\" i like some the gaga songs. what the fuck does she know about cameras? so it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians- the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products, right? so you'll say \"hey, you know what? i've got this water and we've got, you know, we've got this red version. we got a red bottle, and we've got a david beckham version here, then we got a blue version.\" so my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it, when i understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through. so, i understand we want to make it about music but i wanted to take this step to say, we got this new thing called \"classism\". it's racism's cousin. this is what we do to hold people back. this is what we do. and we got this other thing we got that has been working for a long time where you don't have to be racist anymore it's called \"self-hate\"; it works on itself. it's like real estate of racism. where, just like that, when someone comes up and says something like \"i am a god\", everybody says \"who does he think he is?\" i just told you who i thought i am, a god! i just told you! that's who i think i am! would it have been better if i had a song that said, \"i am a nigga\"? or if i had song that said \"i am a gangsta\"? or if i had song that said \"i am a pimp\"? all those color and patinas fit better on a person like me, right? but to say you are a god? especially, when you got shipped over to the country that you're in, and your last name is a slave owners. how can you say that; how could you have that mentality? zl: i mean, i know in the past you've talked about, like, you know, building hotels, doing things beyond people's normal frame of reference. they know you as kanye west, an artist. they know you're moving into fashion, but these things in a way i guess are hard on people to comprehend because they don't have that level of drive. do you know what i mean? has it always been like this for you? have you always felt like you can set your mind on anything and you will achieve it, ultimately? kw: i've always felt i can do anything. that's the main thing people are controlled by, thoughts- the perceptions of themselves. they're slowed down by the perception of themselves. if you're taught you can't do anything you won't do anything. i was taught i could do everything and i'm kanye west at age 36. so just watch the next ten years. zl: yea yea yea.

            "lyrics": " well seeing that, i think i, maybe for one of the first times in my life, i understand how it is to feel humbled. i want to say some \"thank you\"s really quick. thank god for stephen hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. so, make some noise for stephen hill to start this so, since this is pre-taped and the fact that adam blackstone used to be my music director, i'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. if i go chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when i went and visited minister louis farrakhan, and i just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that i had been talking about over the past couple years. and it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. you know, at the barbershop and everything, i used to hear people talking about, \"you know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude.\" but i want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. so it ain't got nothing to do with the money and it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, robert kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his bentley, they wrote \"nigga lover\" because robert kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got o.j. off. she had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. and he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"dad why you going so crazy?\" he said to her, \"one day you may have a black child. a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. and it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.\" so, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. the bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why i'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. and they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea harriet tubman said she could have freed so many more, and i'm sorry mom if that was incorrect english. harriet tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. so don't think that because we can afford this custom balmain suit that we're free. and don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. and don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. it's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. slaves to the perception. slaves to the idea of being cool i thought it was so appropriate the way wayne brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. for us to express ourselves. our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. our oil is our expression, is our influence. don't never let them take that away. and when we have the chance to express it and influence, don't only do it for us, do it for the human race ",

(all laughing) kw: but! but! i don't like \"fourfiveseconds\"! and why did you do that at the grammys? (laughing) ctg: i do like \"fourfiveseconds\" though ay: he loved that song ctg: i don't like the auto-tune when you sing but i like \"fourfiveseconds\" kw: i don't like auto tune either but i need it ctg: really? why? i hear people say that, why? kw: cause, i could do, i can like bend my voice in other ways, like at the end of runaway and everything? i like to do that ctg: i got you. and thank you for inviting me to the fashion show as well kw: yeah ctg: i didn't feel like i belonged there ay: we thought it was a set up, he's gonna walk in (laughing) envy: we definitely thought it was a set up, we said he's gonna get beat up in there, he's gonna get jumped ctg: i felt like it was only right. you came here, you know what i'm saying? through all the slander, why wouldn't i come to the fashion show? kw: yeah envy: you put him next to drake which was kind of awkward ctg: they didn't put me next to drake. i went to stand in the back and drake happened to be back there ay: charlamagne was standing by drake the whole time envy: now lets talk about your shoes that just been released, yeezy boosts kw: yeah i heard y'all don't like those ay: no not y'all, i said that i actually have a pair of shoes that look like them and i like them ctg: that's not a good thing when a girl has shoes that look like mens shoes ay: why? ctg: i like the black colour. the grey colour when i first saw them looked like a paper mache project. but the black ones look tough kw: yeah we coming with the black ones real soon ay: but that is a big accomplishment for you, you put that out, limited run at first, and they sold out and now people are buying them online for over $1500 envy: 1500 for them kw: yeah see i don't want them to be limited, that's something that the company did. i wanted as many people to get them as possible. and i don't want the price to be $350, i don't want to play this sneaker culture game and all this where they be reselling them for higher prices and stuff, i just want people to have what i make. there's no limited release to the college dropout, or a limited release of graduation. you know and i think in clothing right now there's a real separatism, there's $5000 sweat shirts everybody spending that money trying to show up in the club, and act like they.. you know what i'm saying? we need to spend that money on our families. my point, and what i'm doing in clothing right now is i'm going and taking the talent. i came from the ralph show and i was talking to ralph like man, i need your help, cause you know how to make clothes and i think i know what my generation wants. but it's very difficult if you don't have that production and that experience that ralph has. and it's really difficult to get those price points, you know the zara and h&m price points if you don't got the factories, if you don't got the boats. you know i talked about this before ctg: so why is it $350? cause it's hard to.. kw: i have no idea they just priced it that. i think they just, i think their logic was they didn't want it to go from um, the other company and go to adidas and be like man, why they drop the price? cause sometimes the public won't always understand the transition. like steve jobs always had the ipad in his head, but he couldn't do it coming from a keyboard and a floppy disk to the ipad, he has to walk people in to this envy: i thought the whole idea of you going to adidas was you would have more control, and it was your ish, and you could do everything ctg: over price points kw: yeah i do have a lot more, at least i could do something! but any relationship that starts off you ain't gonna have all the control. you know what i'm saying? it's a marriage. usually the first year of any situation is the toughest, and then when you guys start to communicate, you know it cane be powerful envy: now explain this to me. i'm a sneakerhead, i have tonnes of sneakers. i assumed it to be like, i don't like to compare, but the other sneakers you did, like leather, they were more of a sneaker sneaker, like you could ball out in your others sneakers, this one i don't think i could play basketball in kw: you actually could play basketball in this one better. because first of all its got boosts which is the best technology and i'm not just saying that contractually with adidias, i'm saying that from someone that goes to the gym, and if i'm wearing that like my boosts actually i feel better cause i have problems with the back of my achilles from performing so much ctg: i did say fat girls with cankles, it look like they'll be comfortable for them kw: yeah! i mean people joke that they look sorta like the uggs, right? but what's really bugged out is i'm actually working on trying to make a sexier ugg. cause you see uggs all the time envy: they are comfortable kw: and i see, you know, i see stuff for the future. i'm always, i'm such a futurist that i have to slow down and talk in the present. this was a proposition to where i think shoes will go. i think the colour palates, with the red over here and the thirty different colours, the black history month version and all that, i think that's gonna be out of there in the future. this is for me, as humbly i would say i am the most influential person in footwear right now ctg: there's no way to humbly say that kw: well truthfully, i am the most influential person in footwear. envy: those are re-releases but when it comes to new sneakers i think he is ay: how hard is it to get that balance between wanting to get something people can afford, but then also wanting to use those materials and make things really special, you know things that make them more for you kw: yeah those materials is all a game that the factories play too. silk is in style, silk is more expensive from the factories. you can get everything for a better price, it's all in how you negotiate with the factories. and my end goal, ten years from now will be to have everything at a zara level, like i think when steve made it with phones, it wasn't a show of class anymore. you know you had the vertu phone, the $4000 phone you felt like you was better than somebody ctg: i don't understand this talk at all kw: the phone, i'm talking about the vertu phone ctg: oh phones! kw: yeah i'm not clear a speaker, you know i had this car accident and everything and i just and ever since then i've been a mumble mouth. but what i'm saying is, people are trying to put on a jacket to try and act like they are better than you. i think this idea of being better than the next man is the wrong mentality in the first place. we were born in to a broken world that has been separated by race, religion and class ctg: but you confuse me when you say stuff like that cause you do act like you are better than people kw: no ctg: like the grammy's is a great example, when you run up there and tell everyone respect the artistry, but it's like you're not respecting the artistry kw: yeah that. and i deserved it that was completely hypocritical. i'm go ahead and tell y'all like the other day. i went to dinner and i sat down with taylor swift, right, and ironically they were playing the beck album ay: ironically or you think they did that on purpose? kw: no they did it on purpose so i could finally hear it and i was like man ctg: so you hadn't even heard it when you did the grammy rant? kw: i was like man, this is like kinda good, i ain't gonna lie (all laughing) ctg: so you hadn't even heard the beck album when you did the rant? kw: nah! i hadn't even heard it man, i just (all laughing) ay: charlamagne you do that all the time, you say somebody is wack without hearing the album ctg: but i admit it! when did i do that? that's not true. i can't even say if beck didn't deserve it cause i didn't hear it ay: and that was an argument we had cause i was like kanye might not know, a lot of people hadn't even heard beck, i'd never heard it, so. people were saying no i'm sure he heard it, he had to have heard it to say that kw: you know what? i bet you the album is really good. i'm gonna listen to the album and maybe it was potentially an album of the year but the grammy's still have a commercial component to it. they wanna sell commercials, so they have these big superstars sitting in the audience and they're advertising they're performing 'coming up next' that's what they try to do to get those views. you don't have these people sitting here and you know, have them and their hearts beating and stuff like we work too hard for all that, to be losing in a situation where, cause i mean who's winning? we don't get none of that advertising money. y'all don't play with us. that's what my main point it ctg: why you think superstars go where they're tolerated, like yourself you go where you're tolerated but not celebrated. you don't come to the soul train awards, or the bet hip hop awards, you'll hear 'kanye won' but kanye is not here to accept this award kw: that's why we need to support the people that support us, and not just particularly a black thing. we always say this is a black show, you know it's gonna be a while. i ain't got the answers on how to change the voting system, i ain't got the answers on how to make it everyone is honoured in the proper way, and sometimes maybe there's two people that should win. who's to say who should win? but i think it'd be a class thing to. you know it carries more weight if you win a grammy than if you win a bet award, so we still go ctg: says who though? kw: says society. and this is what this is about, this is why i respect this show because this is the voice of society, this is i'd say the voice of the barber shop, this the voice of the streets, and you know the grammy's are, it's a statement of classicism. like if you go to my house imma hit the stunt button for a second. you see my 21 grammy's laid out that my wife forced me to take out of the bathroom and put in one place ctg: that's why it's interesting to hear you get at the grammy's cause you could be selfish and say 'well i've got 21, whatever' kw: yeah i mean i think i deserve more (all laughing) kw: you know it\u2019s all, like i said we was born into a world that\u2019s separated by class, race, and religion. so class is one of the things people want, you want to be first class, but in a plane crash everybody dead. it ain\u2019t no class then, it\u2019s just a whole crash. some of the things, when i first came out with the idea of donda and i was tweeting out all these idea; airplane design, this design, this design. you know you see of course like me and kim, we can take private but we really wanna be in the airport, we wanna be next to the people. i get inspiration when i see what people are wearing, i get inspiration when i see what people are going through. i see people walking a line slower or getting patted down, you know i gotta tell you this one good story about class. i was going to london where i\u2019m going tonight, and i was in the first class line and it was real crowded. and i looked at the coach line for customs and it was completely empty. we went over to the coach line and got through right away. and everybody that\u2019s sitting there with their hermes belts and their big hats, they didn\u2019t want to lower they class in order to get through faster when time is the only luxury. it\u2019s a lot of stuff that i\u2019ve been learning over the past couple of years and i\u2019ve used my money and my position and my relationships to learn about class and i think my approach is i think more, robin hood now ctg: its more ghetto. even though you\u2019re getting up in class its still rachet kw: yeah i guess. i mean ghetto is fun. i\u2019m from chicago, my wife got a big ass, we stay ghetto envy: did you reach out to beck after though? did you reach out to beck after you heard his album like maybe i slipped up a little bit, maybe i went too far? kw: yes i got his number and i was supposed to call but i keep forgetting ay: what? you did not forget, you just don\u2019t know what to say ctg: don\u2019t feel bad because i thought beck was a beer until you jumped on there ay: beck was very humble about it though, he agreed. he was like \u2018yeah i mean, beyonce should\u2019ve won\u2019 it wasn\u2019t like he disagreed with you. but i felt bad for him kw: no i felt good for him because think of all the good stuff that happen to me in the past 7 days, 8 days. the person that won the most is beck. because if i hadn\u2019t done that then his album of the year would have never been mentioned. now its in all the chatter; \u2018kanye west messes up again\u2019 \u2018kanye west donkey of the day\u2019. you know i\u2019m already the enemy so you can\u2019t get no worse than the villain ay: it has to be hard to win an award and have all these different people saying you shouldn\u2019t have won. and then you have the beehive going in and leaving negative nasty comments and how terrible he is ctg: well its all subjective though kw: yeah it is all subjective but but you know, he should win an award for what he did. you know, rock album or something like that. but he shouldn\u2019t have won that award in my opinion. but who am i to have an opinon. ya know? ctg: you\u2019re kanye west kw: exactly ctg: if you don\u2019t respect it then it\u2019s not to be respected. but one thing we always ask in the barbershops is why is kanye always caping for beyonce? i love beyonce, i\u2019m a pinkett-smith-winfrey-knowles-carter, but it seems like you\u2019re always coming to her aid. and nobody, beyonce don\u2019t need no caping she\u2019s beyonce kw: i know it\u2019s really ironic that it\u2019s always beyonce for some reason. why is it beyonce? why don\u2019t i go off on whoever going off on my wife on twitter? i think beyonce is a great representation of an artist working hard and trying their best and getting the results from it. so say beyonce\u2019s previous album wasn\u2019t as well received as this new album, and she got low like how i got low on my new album, and delivered something that everybody loved. in america we have to respect greatness when we see it and we can\u2019t smack it in the face at the cost of some votes splitting, at the cost of blowing someone who can sell some t-shirts. if you see something that\u2019s great, you got to respect it. i remember i was trying to get on the basketball team in 8th grade, i hit every free throw, hit every layup, and i looked on the list and i wasn\u2019t on the list. and the coach just gave me the kanye shrug kw: you know that\u2019s like the best thing cause you get to leave school... ay: get all the chicks kw: yeah. we had a small gym, where like you\u2019d run into a broadway stage like if you hit a layup and stuff ctg: so hurt people hurt people. he probably said \u2018kanye i\u2019mma let you finish but you\u2019re not going to make this basketball team kw: now my point is, you not gonna have somebody hit all the shots and you not give them that credit. and i think a lot of times its exactly what you say, beyonce don\u2019t need no help. people look at beyonce cause she's rich, respect to hov she\u2019s a beautiful woman, she\u2019s talented. and so they figure she\u2019s got everything and so you don\u2019t even need nothing else. but i think she deserves the proper accolades because she\u2019s an inspiration ctg: she got 20 grammys! 21..20? ay: not album of the year cm: i thought she did win that one went there for album of the year kw: i don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever one an album of the year grammy. and this is funny because taylor was talking to me about this. she was saying that when she was the victim she won every award and now that she's powerful and the biggest selling artist, now she's not winning awards anymore, cause they're like \"what do you need?\" it's once again, it's that moment where the rich people, our line is getting clogged up because it's a practical joke that everybody in the airport is playing on the rich people, as they should, because as rich people, our focus shouldn't be on how we get a new phantom, how we get a bigger house. our focus should be on how do we help the middle to the lower class to have a better life. and i think that we get distracted with luxury, so-called luxury goods, so-called luxury cars, like... and i embrace this, any time a rich person gets the piss taken out of them it's cool, don't do it to me all the time and stuff but... ctg: but you know that's always what we felt about you because you used to speak up like when you said george bush don't care about black people, you were speaking up for the have-nots. but now it seems like you were just fighting for the civil rights of rich people lately. (laughter) kw: i think it's the rights of everyone. and another thing that i used to get really caught up on was with race. you know, with race it's like, okay we know it's racist people, we know that a lot of white men over the age of 60 are racist, we embrace that. we know that a lot of people that are in power don't really... they're like donald sterling. we understand that. we know that, but the world is moving. 10 years from now, 20 years from now, every person of color or female or any minority that comes into power will eventually shift it. you got the ozone layer, you got all this stuff you see 100 years from now the entire world might be black. just to even survive on the earth, period envy: now you mentioned you stood up for beyonc\u00e9, people asked, you stood up for beyonc\u00e9, you stand up for her maybe more than you stand up for your own wife. recently, people been going at your wife crazy, from the paper magazine cover, they say, \"why would she do that? she has money, is it just for fame? is it just for instagram? is it just for attention? you know even amber rose came on the program a couple of days ago and said your wife was fake. how do you reply to all of these people and what do you say to everybody? even with us, when we seen her on the cover it was kind of like, yo kim is filthy, you know, she has a child, she has a family, why would she do that cover? kw: which question... let's do the cover first. one of the things in breaking class is respected art can break class. so one of the things that shut up a lot of people is the fact that jean-paul goude took the photograph, that used to shoot grace jones. and grace jones' figure, physique was as new and different as kim's physique was. and our position of power, we're not gonna accept the physique that was given to us. you know, that was told to us that was the proper way to look. my daughter has a chance of being shaped like my wife, so until she, between this age and 'til the age she's like that, i'm gonna be fighting for that shape to be considered the highest of class. or not the highest of class, at least equal to what someone looks at, like a skinny model for. my first introduction, one of my first introductions to beauty was the helmut newton book, this really big book, and every woman in there was naked. this is a straight photographer, he did playboy and he'll do st. laurent ads and the highest level taste, and i was really drawn to the beauty of the way their photographs were set up and to the fact that i was attracted to the women also. i liked the two things at once. i like the physical attraction and i like the way the shot was set up. i think that with my wife, it had been a lot of times earlier in her career where she didn't have the access to that level of photographer, of course he's passed away now. so now that she has the access to a jean-paul goude, a steven klein, a , i can name all the really high level, jackie nicholson, all the high level photographers, now, you know it's important for her to stand, i think, for her to stand up in all of her glory and all her power. now her power is in her body, is in her nudity. her power is in her mind, her power is in her family, but body is one of the powers ctg: what happens when she gets older, though? kw: well, she's got, she gon' always have that body but she's gonna have mind, family, and she's gonna create a legacy ctg: you know, you name all those brands and stuff but the hood don't know that so the hood, the hood is like, \"kanye, just tell your wife she don't gotta get naked no more.\" kw: but, she can get naked if she wants to, it's not illegal to get naked and, you know, and then think about this, like if adam had never ate the apple, we'd all be naked. so... ctg: you hit us with that last time, i still have not understood that one in two years. i've been tryna figure that one out for two years ay: but listen, do you feel compelled to reach out to amber rose, being that that's your ex-girlfriend and saying, \"listen, calm it down, leave my wife alone and just chill out.\"? kw: she's just soaking in the moment, nobody feel compelled to do nothing. if kim had dated me when i first wanted to be with her, it wouldn't be an amber rose. you know what i'm saying? like... (laughter) envy: so it's your fault, kim, it's your fault. he holla'd at you before ctg: but amber said kim was sending you naked pictures while y'all was together though kw: i wish. i would have gladly, happily have liked to. cause by the way it's very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that's with amber rose so she wasn't sending nothing, you know what i'm saying? like i had to take thirty showers before i got with kim, you know? (laughter) i'm sorry, please.. wait, don't ask me no more cause i just wanna be respectful, man ctg: listen, i saw you say, i was watching something on tv and they said you were saying that fashion lines didn't want to deal with you cause you were married to a reality show star. just on a business level, cause personally we can tell you're happy, just on a business level do you feel the kardashian brand has hurt kanye west's brand? kw: no, it's helped. cause it just showed, like, my ability to bring mos def into the studio with jay z. my ability to bridge the gap. to bridge, you know, somebody's sitting over at this lunch table, they're the fashion world, they're all cool and stuff and somebody's sitting over at this lunch table, they're a celebrity and they have a perception about that. and you know, i showed people the power of what happens when you work together. and now, you know, kim can sell a dress faster than any magazine cover ay: and you got her on the cover of vogue which is something we thought was never gonna happen, the way that anna wintour felt and how she had expressed that in the past envy: what did she say? she said something today or earlier today? ay: oh about bringing north west to the fashion show. that was alleged though, they said allegedly she said that's not the proper place for a child. you know? kw: yeah i can't speak on alleged comments ctg: does it bother you when you see the news and they're like, \"north west was crying at a fashion show\", i mean she's a baby, that's what babies do ay: and she's at her daddy's fashion show, which makes sense, i mean i think you would want your daughter front row at your fashion show kw: yeah, yeah, i mean think about it, no one can tell me where to have my child or not, you know? envy: i got four of them and they cry. you can't tell them when to cry or when not to cry, they gon' cry ctg: dame dash at the bet awards, bet honors. why'd you let him present you with that award? kw: because he presented me to the world. you know, i wouldn't have a record deal if it wasn't for dame dash envy: how was that first conversation? cause at one time he hated you, well i'm not gonna say he hated you but he was very upset ay: i don't think he hated you, he just felt you weren't loyal to him kw: and i wasn't, and this was an extremely visionary move on my part to move with, to roll with jay z envy: it was a smart move ctg: did you tell dame that? if he's the one that believed in you then why does hov get the credit and the \"big brother\" records? kw: i mean, i mention dame a lot in raps, but you know, the story is not done. you know, sometimes it's been moments where like i was wildin' out and jay was like, \"ye you got to sit this down right now, sit these couple plays out\" and you know, it was the moment when roc-a-fella split. it made more sense for me career-wise to roll with jay even though dame had supported me. and i wonder, i say, where would we be, you know, if i had rolled with dame? would we have been, would i have been more successful? would i have been less successful? i can't say, but at that time, you know, i came to roc-a-fella because jay z was my idol. and it would have been very hard for me, you know, at that young state where i was to separate from my idol. you know, and that's the decision i made and then do i say there was some disloyalty or not? yeah, i own up to that. is it anything that me and dame could do together now to make money? i think so. will i do it? ctg: he's got a film company, right? kw: yeah we're gonna work on films and actually i really like the films that he's doing. he had all types of ideas and dame is like the original person who understood culture and really was in it in every situation and would go, you know, beans had a problem, he would go pick beans up. he'd have us on a jet with them, talking to us direct, talking to me and glc directly. he was talking to me about glc with the film company, like \"yo we gotta put out glc's album\", you know just kind of reminding me, similar to what you was saying last time we was talking about having the real niggas, you definitely got to say dame's a real nigga. so when he came over to the crib and i just saw him, i missed him, man i missed the good, i missed the bad, i missed all of that because all of that is what created college dropout. that tension, all of that is what created late registration. and we creating something new now in the fashion world and in the film world envy: we realized the other day that you still have a love for music and the reason i say that is i don't know who we were talking to (tyga), we was talking to tyga, we was talking to ty dolla $ign, and i heard a remix with so many different people, and it's like kanye's in the studio working with everybody ctg: you've always got the new guys that may not even be next in the studio with you so you keep your ear to the streets kw: you know i just gotta, i have to work. you know i think a lot of times people get rich, people get comfortable, people fall in love and everything. you know, i went to this drake concert in germany. i flew to the concert to go see it. and he got this one line where he say like, something about people be falling in love with famous girls and dadada and they don't have be working as much. and he rapped it, and then when he rapped it he knew i was in the concert so he like looked down and stuff ctg: \"too in love with fashion and women\" or something like that kw: yeah something like that but you know, he was right. you know what i'm saying? i gotta get on my job and that's why i got on the end of that \"blessed.\" hello, i'm back! we back in the studio, it's times that i gotta go pick my daughter up and take her to dance class in the morning and i try to create a regiment, but at least if i go to the studio like 6 hours a day. and it's funny cause when i first sat with tyga, like me and virgil seen tyga at the balmain store and we knew he was fresh. you know, certain people, they have a certain talent with clothing: a tyga, a$ap rocky. certain people got a certain talent with the bars and shit: young thug, big sean. you know, and i sat in the studio with, it was me, thug, sean, travi$, tyga, and i was just saying how we gotta bring our resources together. we have to see how we can help each other to make each other way fresher, share information, build, have cyphers like back in the wu-tang era, like people used to have cyphers. so last night when i working on \"all day\" at q-tip's house, it was like me, vic mensa, q-tip, and we was just building on culture, culture, culture and instead of trying to write bars, we built on that and then i started writing the bars. then they started coming and we started bouncing ideas off each other so with me, i'm only a humble servant. if you have power you have to empower. you have the power to give power away, what i said on the song, \"power.\" \"no one man should have all that power\" is a true statement. no man has the power, the power is in the people. the people give you the power. the people chose me to be the people's champ. soon as i go up and talk about, \"i, i, me, me\" you lose that. and then you got next generations, you got, no matter how i hard i try, drake is gonna speak to a generation in a way that i might not have been at that same basketball game he was at. that same high school game, watched that same tv show, went to that same club. tyga's gonna speak to a certain generation, big sean's gonna speak to a certain generation, and it's important for a revolution, like common said on that song he just won for, it's the youth and the ogs have to come together. you need the energy of the youth and the knowledge of the ogs ctg: that's in the bible, old men for council, young men for war kw: that's why i sit with puff, i sit with dame, i sit with jay, i sit with farrakhan. i talk to the ogs and try to figure out how we can help each other ctg: now with tyga, mentioning tyga, you're executive producing his album. do you feel like his relationship with your sister-in-law is inappropriate? kw: i think that, that's a good question right there. i think he got in early, i think he was smart. (laughter) ctg: i told him he's redshirting her, and i said that's a great redshirt prospect, and let's be clear, russell was 35 when he met kimora, she was 17. but i'm from the south too so i don't know kw: they're closer in age than a lot of relationships that i know, you know? ctg: he's 25, she'll be 18 in august kw: yeah i knew tyga was smart ctg: tyga came up here though and said they were just friends. i mean that's what he's supposed to say but... kw: yeah i can't speak on that, i can't speak on nobody's relationship ctg: thank you ye, we appreciate that a whole lot, ye envy: your album, what kind of album are we getting? what should we expect? kw: bars. songs. you know, cook out music that just feels good, you know, like my last album was a protest to music. i was like, \"i'ma take my ball and go home.\" if y'all ain't gonna let me play the way i wanna play or do clothes or do this, start shootin' the ball real slow, might be at the free throw for a long time just... that was my whole album. the album don't even got no music. i just let y'all have a little music on there on \"bound\" but that was it. but this album's just embracing the music, embracing joy, and being of service to the people. i just hope that people like it and enjoy it, you know? that's it ctg: you mentioned minister farrakhan, i also saw you say when you was backstage at the grammy's you said you didn't want to speak to much cause you didn't want to jeopardize your clothing line, but a lot of people don't like to stand next to the minister cause they feel like he jeopardizes their business. why are you not afraid to show your relation with the minister? kw: you know, it's interesting cause i actually asked for the minister to give me my bet visionary award and he felt like it wasn't the right time, and maybe for reasons just like that. right now i'm working on a documentary with him about him and about his music. he's a classically trained violinist. and he's also one of the most humane people and now he's got that stamp in the same way how my wife was stamped with the sextape, the minister was stamped with (bigotry) yeah. and it's important that while he's still alive he has to see the people appreciate his message, cause you ever hear him talk, it's about humanity. it's about one race. soon as you hear his name, i see peoples' faces change, they have a perception. it's a lot that i can learn from him, perhaps the minister mentioned beck won too many times, or something like that and it's things i can learn in my path of how to always keep my communication as open as possible cause right now it's right at that tip where it's like... yeah we gotta have him cause he's gonna bring some excitement to the grammy's and all that. but we're working on this documentary and it's amazing, it shows that he had a white violin instructor, but then he talked about because he was black he couldn't get the white instructor and there was no black instructors that could instruct him well enough. and he talks about how he was asked to stop doing music, he had to choose between the nation and music and then how the honorable elijah muhammad asked him to come in one day to play the violin and he embraced his passion of music and it's a beautiful story about a beautiful soul that's very misunderstood and one of almost powerful messengers and it's very important that we protect our messengers, very important that we support them ctg: yeah the minister's very sharp. you think it's kind of confusing when he'll say negative things about jewish people but then say we should learn from them? that's kind of a confusing method kw: yeah we definitely should learn from them. we should learn from us, i'm tired of the \"us\" and \"them\", us meaning we should learn from human beings. the first thing i think we're going to do to stop racism is stop focusing on racism. and i understand that it's somebody going to work right now that has a white boss that's talking down to them because they're black. i'm not trying to deny that, but i'm saying we understand that people is different races, it's like light skinned against dark skinned. it just slows down the conversation, i don't know if it's 8, excuse me for this statement ctg: it makes a great joke and stuff kw: yeah, yeah it does ctg: especially on the light skinned envy: shut up (laughter) kw: also every... people are human beings so everything this man says, when i talk to him pretty much everything he says is correct, but everything a person says is not gonna be correct. every move a person makes is not gonna be well timed but sometimes those mistimed moves can inspire the next generation like pac used to say. he said, \"i might not change the world but i'ma inspire somebody that changes the world.\" when i think about, okay i wanna do surround vision, i wanna do my movie theatre, i wanna do my clothing line, i wanna do this, my goal is, man maybe there's a 4 year old that's gonna see that and cure cancer one day. maybe we could keep... if your job is inspiration, you have to keep pushing that at all costs cause you never know who's gonna be inspired by that. and a lot of the reasons why i'm successful now is the people who work with me now grew up on the college dropout. you know, before when i was going in years ago, everyone they listened to rock, they liked bruce springsteen, like they don't even know about the college dropout. so now they know what we brought to the table, and they wanna be a part of this, this movement in a way ctg: last year when it was so much racial tension and you know the police brutality and stuff, like it's almost like people wanted you to say something. were you purposely falling back from being vocal about the mike brown situation and things like that? kw: yeah my dad would email me and say stay out of it. my dad is like a thousand times smarter than me, and a thousand times more social than me. he like literally lived at a homeless shelter. he emailed me and told me stay out of it, that's my only parent, you know, so i have to listen to him, sometimes envy: why, why'd he say that? kw: i think he was just trying to be protective of his son. you know, i can't run in front of every bullet. i just can't run in front of every single bullet ctg: is it in the music with this album, maybe? kw: oh yeah, we definitely... yeah, you know i'm always gonna talk about what's going on, like marvin gaye would say. it's definitely gonna be in there ay: how much of this album is done? kw: uh i think 80 percent, i'm tryna get it finished. i'm tryna get it to the people as soon as possible envy: how are you gonna release it? is it gonna be like a... ay: suprise? ctg: you can't have a release date, you can't do it, it's played out. it's last year's fashion, you can't do it kw: 100% release dates is played out, so the surprise is gonna be a surprise. there goes the surprise envy: no surprise ctg: now one thing the hood all wants to know, where did that soft whisper michael jackson voice come from? it debuted on the kris jenner show a couple years ago envy: when did the hood wanna know that? ay: i don't think the hood watches that show ctg: you've used it in more than that setting. where did that come from? is that like a... i don't know, you're in a shell? i dunno kw: man don't, nobody wants, the worst thing... the thing that america doesn't want... america and the world, they antagonize black men. black men aren't intimate in their own country and they're not in power and all this so you constantly get poked at. but the thing that they hate the most is the angry black man, even though they can cause you to be angry. they hate that, and you know, if you could just understand how to not get angry, in a boxing match, you know if you get angry, you lost. this is a match of life, a match of culture, and if i'm angry all the time i've already lost. so i just need to stop being angry. and people say, yeah what does he have to be angry about? i got enough to be happy about to focus on that, to not be angry about stuff, and plus it helps you work better, when i'm calm envy: now the hood wants to know, this is a barbershop question, does beyonc\u00e9 and kim have a problem? cause it seems like people pin them against each other ctg: question mark, boom. does beyonc\u00e9 and kim have a problem? kw: nah they love each other. they respect each other. when beyonc\u00e9's working on her album she has pictures of kim on the wall because kim represents powerful women. kim be playing, what's the song, \"i know you care\", what's that song? ctg: \"7/11\" kw: yeah, \"7/11\", playing that video, playing it for our daughter ctg: kim's not the only picture on the wall, right? kw: no it's some other (laughter) ctg: i was like \"that's weird\" kw: they definitely respect each other but it's all... maybe there's a lebron james - kobe element to it but i ain't say that... (laughter) ctg: but they're not even in the same lane, like kim don't sing and she's not entertaining envy: in the bad mommy lane ay: the milf lane, is that what you're tryna say? envy: i wasn't gonna say that... but they're bad, beautiful mommy lane ay: when it comes to raising north west, does it concern you? are you like, okay, obviously she's gonna be spoiled because we're her parents, but does it concern you that you wanna make sure she's got some type of street sense or anything like that? do you even think about that? kw: yeah, my friends, we call them her uncles. her uncles definitely gonna put her on and definitely. it's this toy, i wish i knew, what's the name of the brand of the toy, gabe? what's the name of the store we went to? gabe: sweet william kw: sweet william, they got these toys that my daughter got. vanessa beecroft that did the fashion show, she bought my daughter 3 wolves. cause i would see toys that people would see and giver and i'd be like, these toys is weak. she gotta have better toys than this. and sure enough, when she got these wolves from this toy store, she was going crazy, this the happiest i've ever seen her right. so of course, me, i'm gonna go and buy every single toy there. and i was just having a conversation with my wife yesterday like, we can't give her all these toys though. can't just walk in and give her all the toys at once. she's like, \"we'll just give them all for her birthday.\" we can't give her, she can't have everything for her birthday. we're gonna have to piece this out. so i am very conscientious about the idea of someone being too spoiled cause i think i've been spoiled in the past ay: is that where the song, \"wolves\" came from? those wolves? kw: i'm always thinking about wolves for some reason, that's always been on my mind ctg: let's go back to dame for a second kw: i'm just gon' go ahead and give y'all a soundbyte that y'all want, and i'm just gon' go ahead and say it, where the \"wolves\" song came from. i'm just gon' go ahead and say it, cause maybe this will promote it happening, so i'ma go ahead and put it out in the real world. the \"wolves\" song came from a conversation that me and drake had where we was gonna do an album together, and the album was called wolves ctg: jay would've been pissed off about that. cause when jay came here i asked him if he would ever do another album with an artist, i said nas specifically and he said, \"no because me and ye already started that.\" kw: yeah, so and that's what happened. me and jay started talking about watch the throne and drake went and did all the records with wayne and the tour and we never did it but i just went out and put it in the, i put it out in the world ctg: did you ask drake? kw: y'all don't like it then y'all can send it right back ctg: so you asked drake to do an album? kw: yeah i asked him and we talked about it and he said yeah we was gon' do it and actually he was sending beats back and forth. you know, i got this one record with young thug that i think we're gonna put on rihanna's album. i know i'm giving a lot of information away today ctg: that's what you're here for ye envy: we appreciate it, thank you ay: we're excited ctg: let's talk about you and dame, does that effect you and jay's relationship now? kw: nobody's relationship effects any relationship. everybody need to just have a good relationship. if anything, we all helped each other at a certain point and we all see each other at a certain point ctg: do you and jay still have a good relationship? cause you said that was your idol but you work hard so your idols become your rivals kw: i wouldn't be sitting here today right now if it wasn't for jay. jay helped me, period. in every single way that you can think. whether it was like, holding me down when i'm in new york, i'm the dude in the pink polo and the bad attitude. and i'm still here. jay z ay: so is this drake and kanye album gonna happen? kw: i don't know, it might happen cause i threw it out there ctg: don't do it, man kw: he'd probably be mad that i mentioned it on y'all show since he dislikes y'all so much envy: he hates him, the big black bully over there, he hates him ctg: so is it true that one time you were in a restaurant and when you had the pink, back in the pink polo days, some dudes in new york were gon' rob you? envy: chelsea diner, 14th street ctg: and beanie came through with the pistol and held you down? kw: yeah that's true ctg: do you feel like you may owe beanie something for that? kw: i'm not gonna put out some... let me see ctg: ye got media training. this is a new ye, he thinks about things ay: he doesn't want to say something that could be misconstrued ctg: this is a new ye! envy: beans might still be on them papers, let me think about how i'ma say this one kw: okay i know this gon' sound like a somewhat politically correct answer like one of these politician type answers but i owe every hip-hop artist in a way. and i don't mean for you to come to houston street and stand in front of my apartment and ask for beats and a verse or something like that. but i owe hip-hop. you know, just like, saying like, ben horowitz is the only vc out in san fran that believes in rap. you know, he gave nas a piece of rap genius and all that. you know, he used to be in a rap group. but, you know we all owe hip-hop. and i believe that i do have the ability, i believe that i'ma be the head of the first trillion dollar company. and 100% when i get to that point, no rapper would ever have to worry about anything. my plan is to be coming one by one, big daddy kane, here come his crib, everybody's crib ctg: hip-hop reparations? kw: yeah exactly, like the forrest gump moment after he got an apple and came to everybody. i owe every hip-hop artist because i wouldn't have made it this far without all of them. look at my daughter's name, that's hip-hop. her name's nori! ctg: so you did name your daughter after n.o.r.e.? kw: there's an element of that in there ctg: when n.o.r.e. heard \"only one\", n.o.r.e. was tweeting, nah i think he's talking about his daughter. like n.o.r.e. thought for a moment... he did! n.o.r.e. tweeted that! kw: \"only one\" has nothing to do with noreaga ctg: i didn't think so kw: it don't have nothing to do with noreaga whatsoever, but everything else in my life does ctg: let's talk about some of your artists for a second, like you got a close relationship with drake, where at one point pusha t and drake had a little issue. and pusha was hurt because you came out at ovo fest kw: yeah, we got over it. (laughter) ctg: kanye, new kanye, i'm telling you! envy: teyana taylor, what's going on with her? kw: she put out an amazing album ctg: she's your artist, like she's very talented but it seems like you don't support her, like you don't stand by her like you should maybe kw: you know what, i don't support her enough. i need to do more. i need to rap on some remixes. i need to go shoot some videos. a lot of times it just, you know, when you're focusing on clothing, you're focused on your family, your focus is on all these different things, you know. it's hard to put all the focus, but yeah i do need to put some more focus on her. i haven't put enough focus into her ctg: you are a true gentleman. two weeks ago you were bumrushing the stage, calling out beck, far from humble, and now you're humble as can be right now envy: it seems like love for the music, like you brought out fetty wap when he was performing at his show, who's a jersey artist who's pretty new, and it's telling me that you're back to that element of music again, and that's what people are excited about kw: yeah and i was able to get... you know what's so funny is right after i did the fashion show i went to go shoot the \"blessings\" video with drake and sean and i was so happy. i was so happy to be able to go do that. and i used to be resentful of having to do music. but because i was able to shit, now i can take a piss, you know it's like somebody tells you do one you one... ctg: i usually piss first but i feel what you're saying kw: so you know i'm just happy to just keep creating and just inspire people through joy and accomplishment. and like, with the adidas thing, they gave me a little bit of oxygen. i couldn't breathe, y'all was looking at a person suffocating. at least i got some ideas out. maybe that's 10%, 5% of what i really wanna do, like i wanna be supported by disney in the same way how adidas supported me i want disney imagineering to support my ideas. in the same energy that fashion week had and the same front row and all that bob iger, i'm telling you, i'ma bring that, i know, you know, right now our brands might not mix but i'm a family man. thank you for frozen, that's like a second nanny ay: you've been reluctant though to call yourself a designer - at what point will you say, \"i am a designer.\" do you feel like there is gonna be a point or you're just a creator? kw: i don't even want to give myself any form of a title anymore. i'm not calling myself a genius, i'm not calling myself a visionary. the only thing i can say i am is a servant. i wanna serve, and if i can get a group of amazing designers together to create something to be able to serve the public, then that's my job. i'm just a humble servant ctg: how do we know you're telling us the truth and you're not just being politically correct cause of your corporate connects? kw: well you know i'm never politically correct. i just speak from my heart of exactly where i'm at at that time envy: now recently you said when you first got with kim you lost a lot of friends. why was that and who? who were your friends that you lost? kw: you know, when i said that in the interview, i said so-called friends ay: yeah those were just fashion people that you were getting to know? kw: yeah getting to know. it's all this, \"oh should we let him sit at the table, should we not let him sit at the table?\" but there were some people in fashion that did stand by us. there's carine roitfeld, there's riccardo tisci, even anna wintour, they were a part of the anti-kimye movement. they were standing on the front line when there was an anti-kimye movement, and now they're here, every meeting, any meeting, any dinner they have, they'll be like, \"man, see, i told y'all\", like riccardo dressed her, carine put her on a magazine, anna put her on a magazine. so that statement was a little bit out of context because it wasn't everybody, but there was a lot of people, and so be it, they was wrong and we was right ay: do you hold grudges or are you cool to work with people even after that? ctg: you just know they're fake, you know how to deal with them kw: yeah i don't hold no, yeah i've never held a grudge anyway ctg: you can see he's back here ay: they said after you left the station you were really flustered when you went to go see sway and a lot of people were saying, \"y'all messed up his whole day after the interview with the breakfast club.\" kw: that was beautiful, man, at least that happened. at least the \"how sway!?\", i know you was mad you ain't get that part ctg: i'd like the \"you ain't got the answers, charlamagne\" envy: that was a good one though, a good soundbyte kw: you got me suped up, you charged me up for that joint but you know what, it's like he really didn't have the answers, you know, that was incorrect. that was incorrect, what he was saying. i could have said it in a calmer way but he was misinformed ctg: the only thing i was saying last time was those fashion people don't love you, so it's like, why ask them for help? you're kanye, and as you can see, you're doing pretty okay for yourself kw: well i needed that help because still now i got like... one of my head designers worked at margiela for a while. one of... the girl who worked on the shoes worked at celine. i've been pulling that talent from a place that was only for the $4000 jacket lines to a place that we're gonna be delivering shoes at $200, $100, we might get some shoes down to $60. i mean, we about to flip this whole thing on its head, it's a new idea of apparel. and they've got information, and i had to ask them, i had to be humble, i had to beg to go to dinners, and i had to explain to them, \"why should we work with you, ye, how we know you're not just another celebrity that's gonna wear a red leather jacket and you're gonna diss us in public?\" it's been a long journey and now we gained some ground and now i can give some dope shit to the people. but these people are knowledgeable, man, they went to the yale of fashion ay: these are the experts and you're trying to learn from them to get better in the fashion world kw: yeah i hate when people be talking about, \"i just designed a restaurant\", you be like, \"yeah it look like you designed this restaurant.\" ctg: did you get backlash from e when you told terrence j and khloe take the e logos off. the kardashians own a percentage of this kw: that was turnt, i'm really happy i did that, man. that was like, really ignorant ctg: did e give backlash, like, \"kris control your son\" or something like that? kw: yeah because they was happy cause they got more ratings and by the way, my opinion from someone that's knowledgeable, you know, what's offensive to me is overbranding, all that, that's too much. that's not futuristic, that's in the now and in the past. they gotta be forward, man. we gotta promote forward ideas cause beauty is important. if beauty wasn't important, my wife wouldn't be so famous ctg: she don't get insulted when you say that? kw: what? ctg: you said at the afterparty that if it wasn't for beauty, the kardashians wouldn't be famous. if i said that it could come off as insulting kw: but they're beautiful, you know how many people wanna be that beautiful? ctg: but they don't have anything else? brains? kw: obviously they connect to some business sense because they're all successful, family and all multimillionaires. one thing i think about with me is look how long it's taking me to turn any of my friends to a multimillionaire. kim did it like that. she did it out the gate, she was like, \" we gon' take khloe, we gon' take kourtney, we gon' take kourtney's boyfriend, we gon' take the kids, we gon' take this and we all gon' be millionaires like that.\" reality is like rap. it's so futuristic, it's the new... my wife is a visionary at the end of the day. snl wants to make skits and be like, \"what did you do, kim?\" i don't know nobody else that is as successful at what she's doing as her ctg: i only got a couple more questions. was \"only one\" therapeutic for you? like did it bring you to tears in the studio, maybe? kw: yeah, yeah, 100% and it brought my wife to tears. anybody i play it for. and people ask me why did i go \"only one\" over \"all day.\" \"only one\" made me feel like me. it made me feel like this was the song i had to play back in the studio if cam'ron and jim jones and whoever played 30 dipset records, what am i gonna play to be the pink polo? what am i gonna play that's gonna stand out? what point do i have? that was my problem, my issue i had once i got... which i love cruel summer, i think it's amazing, but i felt like i started sort of blending in with the pack in a way, with a record like \"clique\", which was a great song, we still perform it, but it's important for me to innovate. even with drake, i think he'll tell you, it's important to have a yeezus album, it's important to have whatever this next thing is because you need vibes from all directions. you need innovators. my job in life is to innovate. i think that \"only one\" is an innovative record, i think \"fourfive\" is an innovative record, i think \"wolves\" is a less innovative but it's the third proposition this year off the album. \"wolves\" sounds like like 808s a bit, it sounds like signature kanye post-808s, drake whirl record. that's a run-on, you got a proper run-on so you can say you understand what i'm talking about ctg: the record sounds so personal and this may sound crazy but my grandmother who i loved dearly, she was my second mom, she passed away and i had a dream about her and it was like she was talking to me in my dreams. i wonder if you had like a vision of your mother speaking to you maybe, that caused that record kw: yeah that's exactly what it is. i didn't realize i said, \"hello my only one.\" it's literally like those movies you see where it's like someone's talking to you. i murmured that and i realized after the fact i said \"only one.\" and my name, kanye, my mother named me that, it means only one. that's the meaning of my name. then, after the song was out, my cousin, abigail, which i promise i got you some shoes, i'm looking for a size 6, they run a little bit big, said you know that our grandmother, mawmaw used to say \"now i lay me down to sleep, i pray the lord our soul to keep\" before she would put me to bed, and my grandmother actually named me omari, which is the first line, \"hello 'mari.\" so i realized at that point that they were both talking to me. it wasn't just my mom, that my grandmother was speaking to me, these generations. so now i'm working on a video game for \"only one\" and the idea is it's my mother going through the gates of heaven and you gotta bring her to the highest gates of heaven by holding her to the light. we've been working on it for like 6 months ctg: is that why you kept the lights low at the grammys? cause that was the first thing you performed and you felt like you might break down? kw: nah it was supposed to be more smoke on it and the practice version was better and i wasn't completely satisfied with the visuals on the grammys. that's why i turnt up on the snl visuals. i was like i ain't playing, they gotta know i ain't playing. these visuals gotta hurt! ay: working with paul mccartney, i read an article where they compare you to john lennon. has paul mccartney ever said anything to you about that? kw: nah but we talk about any and everything, but i do think that there's the angst that i feel from the world, the angst that i feel from what people are going through in chicago, what people are going through financially, what people are going through with just... i feel like john felt like that. and when i got past the gucci store, and got past how cool my jacket was, i finally was, like the song says, the \"man i always knew you could be.\" when i became a protector, a dad, a husband, i finally could stand up and stand for something envy: well we appreciate you joining us, man ctg: the new improved, media-trained ye! envy: kanye west, we appreciate you joining us, we're glad you came back kw: i'm happy to be here envy: i didn't think you was gonna come back and charlamagne, man ay: i love that this started so different, he loves your new songs envy: calmer guy, humbler guy ctg: well listen, when i gave him donkey of the day last time, what did i say? i said a guy that's so easy to like, but he makes it hard to like him with just a couple antics. but that's part of being human, right? kw: yeah envy: ladies and gentlemen, it's kanye west! it's the breakfast club! good morning!

            "lyrics": " zane lowe: nice to see you again man. thanks for stopping by the bbc for a chat kanye west: good to see you too sir. thank you zane lowe: so, i was thinking today like where do we begin? because you\u2019ve been having some remarkable conversations lately, some really in depth, really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on, you know, successes, things that have kind of made people think, talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like, where were we last time. we were 18 months ago, not far from here and so much has changed in the last 18 months. the first question i wanted to ask you, cause i\u2019ve always wondered how you felt at that time kanye west: i had so many interviews where i\u2019m trying to express that i can create, that i can create outside of just the music box and i\u2019m giving examples of work that i did that was really successful and i\u2019m getting just completely shut down. but not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company, every single company you could imagine is just like \u201cno, you are celebrity. you are not allowed to create, you\u2019re not allowed to think, you\u2019re not allowed to have an opinion. you\u2019re just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up.\u201d and it\u2019s true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know, as i told you last time i said i\u2019m a product guy zane lowe: yea, and it was an electrifying conservation, and i mean, it felt like you were taking names that day, it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what\u2019s occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world. you know, what\u2019s happened recently with yeezy supply, you know your deal with adidas, how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they\u2019ve seen -- how has that experience been for you? how can you put that into context for us? kanye west: i mean, every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it\u2019s a challenge. you gotta work hard and you have to completely, tirelessly, countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what. so that\u2019s the way i\u2019mma word it. you know what i\u2019m saying, so we made it to a point where something extremely close, something almost to the level, something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and adidas was a company that was flexible enough and had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart. you know, they original hip hop zane lowe: of course, run dmc man i mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced, you know, not long after and i wondered when did the conversation actually begin with adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry? kanye west: that conversation had already started before then. there was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um, i remember calling jon wexler you know, it was a certain point where i just felt like i couldn\u2019t breathe anymore like i had all these ideas and i felt like i was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone\u2019s creative, you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a lamborghini complaining about something. and anyone that\u2019s creative understands that there\u2019s no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create. there\u2019s no check out and there\u2019s no cheque to stop you from creative. no pun intended when i\u2019m saying no check zane lowe: was a good one though kanye west: just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because i mean, as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things, there were so many ideas. i mean i look at over 500 images a day on my laptop. and i remember i went into the whole thing about hypebeast, you know i said \u201cpeople be dissing me on hypebeast\u201d and it\u2019s like wait a second, dude, like i been fighting this battle for a long time, since like universe city. like no one has any idea what the meeting were like. i\u2019mma throw this one out here. i remember this one guy that worked for francois pinault the head of kering group came up in my apartment in paris, while i was working on yeezus and i had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with puma. and the guy, actually i forgot about the meeting right, so i had my jacket on and it was a jacket i had done with a.p.c. and i was about to leave, so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and i\u2019m sitting with him, and i tell him like yo i made this jacket. and he makes some joke about, you know \u201cyou did look pretty hot. i\u2019m happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me.\u201d zane lowe: was he joking do you think? kanye west: he was leveling. he was leveling the conversation, this is what people do all the time. like if i meet someone who i respect or i look up to, i will literally like kiss their feet. you know someone that i know that\u2019s put in a lot of work. and it\u2019s a lot of agents, a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level, that will try to level you. you know when they talk to you, they talk down to you. and i\u2019m just sitting like \u201cwhoa, ok.\u201d obviously i have to show him like hey i\u2019m working on this stuff and it\u2019s coming out good and this is all i have a chance to work on. you know like when i worked with a.p.c. i only had two times to look at the collection, you know i couldn\u2019t really grab it and dig into it the way i dig into like working on \u201call of the lights\u201d or something like that, it\u2019s like, there\u2019s a timeline, a cut-off switch, especially when you\u2019re dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently zane lowe: i can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you\u2019re leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year. seeing something like you say, close to the vision you have in your mind. at those early stages, man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said, and getting just levelled kanye west: everyone, everyone i talked to would try to level me. you know. and then there was this guy named hermann deininger that was the head of adidas. and i say \u201cwas\u201d because he passed away recently. and i showed him what i shot in qatar, the cruel summer film, that was using 7 screens, the surround vision idea which we\u2019ve never shown online because you have to experience it in it\u2019s space. it\u2019s the same thing i showed disney and universal, and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film. and which i got all no\u2019s on that \u2013 to date. and this guy hermann saw it, and he believed. he believed that maybe i had something more than how big my rap record was. in me he could tell, he knew, he\u2019s like this guy has something to say and to give that\u2019s past the current box that he\u2019s put in. and he made sure, hermann and jon wexler made sure that adidas deal got done. and the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society. the deal is all about the moment when i can bring a shoe to a kid a foot locker and get on my knees and take it back to when i worked at the gap and put the shoes on his feet. that is what the deal is about. the deal is about when the star of a show is a 5 foot 3 girl, when there\u2019s never been a 5 foot 3 girl as the star of any fashion show. the deal is when the kids came to 42 locations across the world to see yeezy season 1 x adidas originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater, and when they saw that line up, they saw that brigade, they reacted to it when they heard \u201cwolves,\" when they saw the boots, when they saw the runners, when they saw the matrix sweaters, when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back. this is what i fought for. none of this was about me having like a bigger house, a faster lamborghini. it, like, it wasn't about that. it was about these kids having a moment. to be themselves. to be a stronger version, you know, of themselves. i make this stuff to empower people. i feel like there's so many things that are made to, you know, to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it. and i asked my assistant one time. i was like, \"how does these clothes make you feel?\" she said, \"i feel powerful.\" and that's our, that's our main goal. as the song says, \"no one man should have all that power.\" no one man should have it. everyone should have it zane lowe: you seem to be totally, well, a lot more aware of what it is that.. well, in a much, sort of like a more focused way you're able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have. and it feels like you're very attached to the well-being of the people and what they can get out of this. you know, and across the border. and when that moment kind of occurred to you. cause that doesn't happen overnight, you know.. there's.. but it does lead up to that. and 18 months ago you were fighting, you know, you were like really fighting to be heard. and now it seems to me like you're very consciously aware kanye west: yeah, i was still off, you know what i mean? i might have some things that are off now, but i feel like, in the same way when i came up with \"all falls down,\" and i was able to differentiate myself from whoever i was trying to rap like at that point and i found my voice and my message. it's like, i felt like.. zane lowe: that was the moment you felt like that was, yeah.. kanye west: when i wrote \"all falls down.\" that's when i was like, \"okay, this is who i am in the.. this is what i'm, this is what i'm presenting.\" so now i feel like.. it's funny, i would always say, you know, \"i wanna sculpt with marble.\" and it wasn't until i was working on yeezus, and i was learning about furniture and the fact that i am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to french flea markets and the galleries and buy, you know, like furniture that get charged, that rich people get charged a lot for. and one of the things they had was this le corbusier lamp, and it was made of cement, and it was this beautiful sculpture that was...it really inspired me because he made it for zeus, so he made it for everyone. and it was made of cement. so it wasn't the material, it was the idea that was the most important. and i always wanted the resources of lvmh, but it wasn't until i started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey french terry which is a cement in comparison to, you know, the type of materials that louis vuitton might use. that i find a message, a voice, a reason, a reason to create. you know, it was a futile argument for me to say, \"hey, everyone, get behind me so i can make another $5000 jacket that you can afford.\" it's like insane. but now i feel people rallying because they know that i wanna fight for h&m, zara type concept and i know that adidas can eventually get those price points. and i want to apologize to everyone right now because i believe that season 1 may still be in that upper price point and there's still the words \"exclusivity,\" you know, being thrown around. \"exclusivity\" is the new n-word. not nigga, \"exclusivity.\" am i saying the word right? zane lowe: yeah kanye west: yeah, that is the new n-word. cause nothing should be exclusive. everyone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain. the idea of exclusivity is a new colored-people fountain concept. and saying, \"we're gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to, you know, drink at the right fountain.\" you know, we have to reboot our mentality. period. of a generation. you know, it wouldn't even matter if i sold one sweatshirt. you know, as long as this interview gets done, and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference. and they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws, express themselves freely, and overcame it through all adversary, all adversity, means that they can do the same thing. you know zane lowe: yeah. because the thing is when people hear you talking at times i think that there's a genuine consensus from those cause believe me, you're compelling to a lot of people. and, you know, what you say is.. i think you have very unique views on things that should be heard. but some people i think have thought overtime that.. they've obviously missed the point. they've thought that you bringing it back to you. but you're actually trying to open up to everybody else. you're trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know.. if you have to lead the way you have to lead the way. it might not end with you, but maybe if it starts with you is your point kanye west: and i was, i was using the wrong words. my rap was wrong. you know what i'm saying? i was getting the drinks, you know, thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night. you know, cause imagine, think about the type of shit, wild shit you say in interviews. and imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar. \"yo, what up, baby? i'm a genius!\" they be like, \"yo, who's this guy?\" \"no, i'm telling you, i sold all this, i sold this many shoes.\" then she be like, \"yo, chill, chill.\" like, \"gosh, get me out of here already.\" you know what i'm saying? and that's who i was and that was that frustration i had cause i'm seeing like this.. i'm looking at this girl like, \"man, i know that..\" zane lowe: \"we could be good together, this could work.\" kanye west: yeah, i know, i just don't know how to work it zane lowe: so i'm messing it up, yeah kanye west: and the right way so i'm gonna stumble. i was like the 40 year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know.. zane lowe: you're the 40 year old virgin of dealing with corporations? kanye west: yeah. i did not know how to communicate at all. and it's like i had my point, my message was, you know, simply like, \"your egg, my semen, we change the world.\" you know, and i imagine that that's gonna sound wrong zane lowe: that's a hell of a pick up line, man kanye west: i mean, i like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway, you know, because wrong is okay, you know like.. zane lowe: it's okay, it's okay, wrong.. kanye west: we have the right to be wrong sometimes zane lowe: that's a great line. you know i wanted to talk to you.. when we started talking, you know, a while back, music was on my agenda because, you know, i mean, we talked a couple times before as well. and you know i'm a music guy, i mean, it really drives me, and it's a big part of my life. and over the course of this conversation, you know, i wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause i'm fascinated in the certain things i wanna touch on, but i do want to talk about your forthcoming, new record if that's cool. do you want to talk about music? kanye west: yeah zane lowe: cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didn't really wanna talk about yezus. you were like, \"that's cool and everything, but i wanna talk about this.\" and lately, i just, maybe i'm, i feel like you're really energized with music in a big way kanye west: you know, after i did the presentation in new york i was able to get that alien out of my stomach, you know like. i was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the \"blessings\" video with big sean and drake zane lowe: yeah kanye west: and i couldn't have been happier. to go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game. well, let's be respectful and truthful. the hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game. and i fall somewhere in that, you know? in that, that field. so.. zane lowe: getting back to music for a minute, i feel like we're right back, i gotta bring you right back for a second. i want to know what we can look forward to on this record. you talked about cookout music, you talked about what this album represents. and every record you have made has been something new and fresh. you've taken yourself and your craft to a new place. where's your head at right now with this new album? kanye west: just working hard. on it zane lowe: and it's fun? kanye west: and it's fun. and it's fun to work hard and we're being inventive and i've still got some, you know, a lot of opinions and perspectives that i think are important and very.. can be inspiring to people. that fight, and you know, the college dropout came out of a fight to want to rap. and this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design. and.. zane lowe: i wondered about that, cause yeezus was punk-rock to me. that was like, that was sex pistols to me. that was like public enemy to me. that was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial, strong statement. and i wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record. and without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing, the joy is in the hearing. where it's coming from kanye west: i mean, it's a joyful noise onto the lord. like, it is still, you know, the struggle, you know, but the beauty from the struggle. you know zane lowe: as opposed to just the struggle? kanye west: yea, the song amazing grace, you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know, possible. you know i wanna perform \u201conly one\u201d as many times as possible. you know could be vilified or misunderstood, and like i said i didn\u2019t come here to be liked i came here to make a difference. i\u2019m not talking about this interview, i\u2019m talking about life. some people\u2019s job they\u2019re very extremely likeable and i think i could figure that out. i think i\u2019m way nicer to people just in general. everyone i meet i\u2019m extremely nice. but as soon as people start playing games i stop. i stop playing games. and at any moment i can hit that ye button and we can go right back to day one. people be forgetting though, they be forgetting real quick. but it\u2019s all love, and great energy and positive energy. i like the, i like the differences of views and our approach to music like when i\u2019m sitting making music with paul mccartney and i come in i have all these lists of complaints like \u201cda-da-da-da-da!\u201d and this happened and that happened and he say \u201cyo man, it\u2019s all cool though! how bout we make a song?\u201d and we just make song, after song after song after song after song after song zane lowe: he is the most, cause i\u2019ve met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music. and he so gets it in the sense that it\u2019s like kinda let it lead you. let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe i get from him like yea, let\u2019s just see where this goes kanye west: and yea that\u2019s what we did. you know people think that our first two singles don\u2019t have drums but both of those are percussive instruments zane lowe: yea totally that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. that\u2019s like \u201cdun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun\u201d that\u2019s what it is. s i just wanna talk about working with him because i haven\u2019t actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me, maybe i\u2019m wrong, but i just, i love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it\u2019s a natural one. certainly on \u201cfourfiveseconds\u201d i think that\u2019s one of rihanna\u2019s greatest vocal performances period kanye west: she was killing that right? zane lowe: my gosh man. i mean that\u2019s like a whole other attitude that i haven\u2019t heard from her as a star. she\u2019s really gone inside that record and wrangled it. how was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to, it almost has like a 70\u2019s fm american rock, sort of country-rock radio vibe to it, you know what i mean, like something you would\u2019ve heard in los angeles in \u201976 or something kanye west: i mean i liked, i liked songs like that when i was growing up. and i mean the type of chord changes that paul does, i don\u2019t need to understand them, and to be able to be involved with that.. zane lowe: it\u2019s because he invented them kanye west: yea exactly. and be able to be involved with writing a song like that, it\u2019s just like way next to, like meeting paul mccartney is like meeting ralph lauren zane lowe: yea, totally! kanye west: it\u2019s like \u201cwhoa!\u201d zane lowe: dude he\u2019s the greatest kanye west: the greatest of their field, period. of all time zane lowe: and you got to say \u201cwildin\u2019\u201d in a song with him it\u2019s just incredible cause it\u2019s still hip hop, that\u2019s what\u2019s amazing about it kanye west: yea the whole cadence was trap. soon as paul starts playing, i start singing in trap zane lowe: that\u2019s again is the fusion of cultures which i love. it\u2019s what did you call it before when you when you were talking about sean wearing and your shoes \u2013 you were saying, it\u2019s -- i can\u2019t remember what you said kanye west: fusion is the future. period. the mixing of ideas, the mixing of, know the two lunch tables working together, you know. humanity period man, we\u2019re one people and maybe that\u2019s like incorrect english \u2013 i\u2019m sorry mom \u2013 but you know i went to louise wilson\u2019s memorial, you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time. and i\u2019m talking about of all timers. zane lowe: educate us man, tell us kanye west: ok so louise wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school, ever. notorious for not letting people stop at a 7 or a 8, pushing people to a 12. so the first time that i saw one of her students pheobe philo's c\u00e9line collection, i was looking at a 12. when i saw mcqueen\u2019s last show the atlantis collection, i was looking at a 12. christopher kane's bandage collection i\u2019m looking at a 12. alber elbaz i\u2019m looking at a 12. that\u2019s the designer, the designer of lanvin which completely revolutionized the men\u2019s sneaker, fashion sneaker industry. last time i saw her we had dinner at hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in london and i think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter, asking me about my wife. and she said so many students, they don\u2019t give it their all. and the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good, when they\u2019re 2 years old, 3 years old, their parents clap zane lowe: (clapping) kanye west: exactly, that\u2019s what she said, they clap. and she just looked at me, she said \u201ckanye, don\u2019t clap.\u201d zane lowe: aww, what, that\u2019s just! how you getting on with that? kanye west: i didn\u2019t know we were gonna lose her. you know i just um, and she told me she said, you know \u201cthank you for the times you know, when we came to performances\u201d and \u201cthis has like really meant a lot to me.\u201d you know she would\u2014 zane lowe wanna take a minute? we\u2019ll take a minute. let\u2019s take a minute kanye west: that\u2019s never happened to me in an interview before zane lowe: you ok? kanye west: yea, i\u2019m ok, i think i\u2019m ok zane lowe: we\u2019re gonna change the subject. here we go. one of the things you said recently which really kinda made me think was you know you really truly believe that you\u2019re gonna be the head of the world\u2019s first trillion dollar company and the first thing that sprang to my mind kanye was what is that company going to look like? kanye west: johnny ive who is like, in my opinion from what i know, elon musk included, is like the world\u2019s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design. and i said from what i know because there might be other, there might be some others, there are a lot that are great but johnny ive's the best that i know. he said that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so i think that, i think innovation almost gets too much credit, in a way. so, if we talk about this type of company, it wouldn\u2019t be a company of innovation because as steve stoute told me driving down the westside highway \u201cthere\u2019s no money in the innovation.\u201d zane lowe: yea, and he\u2019s got a point kanye west: the money\u2019s in the repetition, you know so.. zane lowe: it\u2019s in the quality kanye west: and making something of better quality for more people. so it has to be a balance of both. i\u2019ve said this a few times but i wanna just say it right here for people who haven\u2019t read it or seen but i think people think that i pander to fashion particularly. you know because, people say \u201cwhy fashion?\u201d it\u2019s not politics, world war it\u2019s not that, it\u2019s fashion, it\u2019s just a jacket or something, it\u2019s just a dress. but i believe that the world can only be saved through design. and i think that the fashion world has.. and when i say through design, i know it\u2019s some snarky classist editor that\u2019s gonna take that and say \u201ckanye west said that the world will be saved with a couture dress.\u201d that\u2019s not what i\u2019m saying. the mentality behind design, you know art is to be free. design is to fix zane lowe: this is important, you\u2019re talking about the actual, like you say the mentality, the purpose behind it, what it means behind the actual product kanye west: no politics, just truth. does it fucking work or not. irrigation, you know, that\u2019s a form of design zane lowe: what are those conversations like, because you, one of the great privileges that you\u2019re in because you know you push yourself is that you get to find yourself in rooms with people that push themselves. so that conversations can be pushed. and i wonder what those conversations are like because i\u2019m fascinated by somebody like elon musk and his absolute inability to be restrained by boundary. and you are very much cut from that same cloth. what is it like when you guys get together and do you talk about things as kind of obvious or as what the future will feel like or is it more casual than that? kanye west: that\u2019s exactly what we talk about. what does kanye west and elon musk talk about? the fut\u2019 zane lowe: the fut\u2019 -- tm kanye west: so when i put out things that if i say hey, i want to work with miucca prada one day on highschool uniforms or something, i just put it out, you know. we just put it out there. or as i told obama last time i saw him, hey, i want, i would suggest that you sit with elon musk. i would suggest that both you guys go to china. i would suggest this. the, i think it may happen zane lowe: must be amazing, those conversations man must be amazing kanye west: i got scared of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times you start to believe it. and i almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but i wasn\u2019t going crazy, i was like the only person that wasn\u2019t crazy. you know what i\u2019m saying like, i just stand there and i just look like \u201cis anyone else here seeing what i\u2019m seeing? none of you guys are seeing what i\u2019m seeing\u201d or it\u2019s just like your maybach and your house is like that important that you won\u2019t move at all zane lowe: it\u2019s distractions kanye west: that you won\u2019t say anything at all in risk of losing something. you won\u2019t say anything on anyone\u2019s behalf at this point? you know so, if you have that ability to do that, to see that, you know that walt disney ability in some way, you have to apply it. you have to use it. you can\u2019t be psyched out. you know, everyone\u2019s on our side. i was just in my own way, but everyone\u2019s on our side and everything that i ever said will happen, will happen. just as much as you guys saw that adidas original yeezys season 1 presentation streamed to 42 locations and you saw that front row. the juxtaposition of the people in the front and second rows to where the people standing in the show had come from is the fusion and is the future. it is the glass shattering of the class system, which is the new racism. class is the new way to discriminate against people, to hold people down, to hold people in a place based on where their kids go to school, how much money they make, what they drive, where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much, you know, how much they have in their account for their retirement. to somehow say that this person right here means more than this person. like i know i tweeted black lives matter but all lives matter. like, my doorman is more important to me than any head of any company. he keeps us safe. my driver, keeps us safe and goes to work every day. the guy painting the windows at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown, you know what the architect suggested, he is just as important as anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne. it\u2019s no more of this separation of what you came from, your race, financial background, education, talent level, beauty. whatever it is that people use to separate people zane lowe: but was that moment, which i didn\u2019t want to talk about but you raised it and i want to actually bring this up because you have to learn from experience. you can\u2019t have all those answers straight away, you have to make those mistakes yourself i think in order to come to that level of clarity kanye west: and i\u2019m not saying i have answers, i\u2019m just saying these are my current opinions. as i gave my current opinions a year ago, this is my current opinions now zane lowe: sure, sure, and that\u2019s great, that\u2019s what we want, that\u2019s why i\u2019m asking questions so we get to hear your answers. but when you, i think\u2026 cause you know i was nominated for that album of the year as well as part of the sam smith album as a producer and a co-writer kanye west: oh, oh wow zane lowe: right, so i was at the awards ceremony with the other producers and co-writers that are part of each records. and, like i\u2019m a huge fan of all the nominees that were nominated and i\u2019m a huge fan of beck and it\u2019s funny that you say, you talk about everyone you want to get it to a place where people can exist in their own terms and that leaves it open for fusion. but then like you say you can just push a button and be back and be old ye, you know old yeezy. is that what happened that night? just \u201cgaaah, i can\u2019t take it i\u2019ve gotta get up on this stage, i\u2019ve gotta wild out.\u201d cause we all thought you were joking. you know what i thought was brilliant about that night? when you did it on the night, i was applauding because i was like, \u201cthat was sun tzu, that was art of war.\u201d he waited for the right platform, went up, pretended to do it, walked back down everyone\u2019s like \u201caww, so funny\u201d i was like \u201che just got the last laugh on this.\u201d and then i woke up the next morning and it was like \u201cnaw, he\u2019s not an artist\u201d and i was like \u201caw man, i love that album!\u201d kanye west: yea, i never said that he\u2019s not an artist zane lowe: ok, i\u2019m misquoting you. but you were talking about artistry. and do you learn form those lessons yourself? is that when you kind of get a little bit closer to understanding what you believe is really important? when you do things like and think, well maybe i did kinda misconstrue that kanye west: i think yea i misconstrued it but i think that everybody has a right to an opinion, everyone has a right to be wrong. you know, there could be a lot of people who feel marshawn lynch shoulda been handed the ball. but there\u2019s a bunch of patriots fans that are happy he didn\u2019t get the ball. and everyone has a right to their opinion. you know, and i expressed my opinion, and i\u2019ll take the weight of it zane lowe: he\u2019s great though. you know, he is great though. there\u2019s three.. kanye west: naw you know as i said on the charlamagne interview when i was ironically having dinner with taylor swift, the beck song starts playing and i was like \u201cthis is really good\u2026 maybe i might\u2019ve been wrong!\u201d you know like, and uh.. zane lowe: it\u2019s a great album man kanye west: and i hadn\u2019t been in like 6 years. and the grammy\u2019s are definitely like an ex-girlfriend. soon as you get in a car with them, you wanna go right back home zane lowe: so we\u2019re gonna get a record this year, and i\u2019m excited to hear it, i really am excited to hear it, and as we draw closer to the end of this particular talk i want to do it once again bring it back to like, the thing that really -- kanye west: only one thing i want to say, people say i\u2019m a hypocrite right? zane lowe: some kanye west: people say that right? zane lowe: some kanye west: yes, i am. 100%. i\u2019m a human being. i\u2019m super hypocritical. i can feel something one time and completely a different way another time. i do it in the design office. i do it in the studio. i\u2019m super hypo- i really love this, i do it when i get dressed. \u201ci love this\u201d (tsk, tsk) \u201ci hate this!\u201d zane lowe: how long does it take you to get dressed on a daily basis? kanye west: 3 minutes. 2 minutes. bars zane lowe: how long does it take your wife to get dressed every day? kanye west: sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes longer. i mean she\u2019s a woman zane lowe: course. you know it seems that um, you know what i love about \u201conly one\u201d is the interaction and the way that you\u2019ve been able to create different generations of your life and of your family communicating with one another, through one another, as a portal. and i love that. and i think it\u2019s one of those songs that successfully does that. and um, i\u2019m a father, you\u2019re a father, it\u2019s the greatest thing of all time. no question about it, it is the great level of all time, it\u2019s the greatest thing of all time. and, you know your daughter is what, 18 months now? 18 months old? you an only child? kanye west: yes zane lowe: do you think about giving her brothers and sisters? do you think about your upbringing and what you went through and how you feel in this life and what it means to have siblings? kanye west: oh, i\u2019m practicing really hard. i try as many times a day as i can. nori this one is for you! you need a sibling! zane lowe: for all the good ones, and all the ones where everyone\u2019s like totally engaged with everything you\u2019re saying, for right or for wrong or whatever, i think you\u2019ve got it totally sussed. i think you know you absolutely know that you\u2019ve talked recently about being the villain, like how you know everyone wants the villain and everyone does well when the villain opens his mouth kinda thing. but then at the end of the day you can go on another interview and you can show a really softer side and a very understanding and very human side that people who know you will tell me you totally are, 100%. and it\u2019s so funny it goes from like \u201cboooo!\u201d to like \u201cyeaaaa!\u201d to like \u201cboooo!\u201d to like \u201cyeaaaa!\u201d and it\u2019s like, i think you\u2019ve got it sussed, i think you know what\u2019s going on all the time with all of this kanye west: you win some games and you lose some zane lowe: you win or you learn right? kanye west: yea, you win or you learn. bam, there\u2019s a jewel, i\u2019ll take that one with me zane lowe: right on, quote book. so album this year, sneak attack, no doubt, no question, sneak attack\u2019s coming and um, and there was a leaked poster that came out as well, you gonna tour with rihanna? is that out there now? has that been confirmed or not confirmed, or what the story with that it? kanye west: i don\u2019t believe i\u2019m supposed to confirm or not confirm zane lowe: so that\u2019s happening. i\u2019ve been long enough in the tooth to know what that means! um, but needless to say you\u2019re excited about returning to the stage in some capacity this year and we\u2019re looking forward to new music this year kanye west: yea, and i been doing a few performances since doing the snl performance, did a couple performances out here and of course gonna do the brits. i\u2019ve been really liking these performances. i feel like these are like the performance version of that you know drake, you know of the 6 god album, of the you know if you\u2019re reading this it\u2019s too late. i feel like i\u2019m a visual extension of what he\u2019s doing like sonically zane lowe: can we talk about drake for a second cause he\u2019s just to me he\u2019s the monster at the moment out there kanye west: you know\u2026 that shit is good yo! zane lowe: dude, \u201c6pm in new york\u201d \u2013 that moment when he\u2019s like opening up and telling the truth about how he feels about his detractors and he\u2019s just basically just opening up what\u2019s going on is my real honesty, not guarding himself or hiding away with any bravado or anything. just like you know, \u201cthey scream my weaknesses and whisper my accomplishments\u201d like pffff i mean that moment for me is just like, that\u2019s what, i mean i love that about him that he\u2019s totally open in the sense kanye west: i mean yea, that element is great. there\u2019s a lot of people that can\u2019t rap that can do that. but the main thing is that fact that he\u2019s delivering you know a level of product \u2013 as i said last interview, i\u2019m a product guy \u2013 and he\u2019s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality. it works. 80% of the time works all the time! zane lowe: that doesn\u2019t make sense! kanye west: haha, but it works. it works. you know what i\u2019m saying. and you have to.. it works. that\u2019s it. and i was just thinking like, i don\u2019t have any advice for this young man, but what i can say is run. fly. go as fast as you can. don\u2019t stop. and you know any time i can be of any service, advice, you know a beat, verse, you know whatever you need. you need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the other company, i\u2019m not supposed to say that! you know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a team. you know, not just me and him. us all zane lowe: thanks man. i always love talking with you bro, i really do. alright we\u2019re good kanye west: got some vibes?

            "id": 319249,
            "lyrics": " the seven most alkaline fruit and vegetables for preventing and reversing dis-ease 1. spinach -all leafy greens should be eaten in abundance but spinach is one of my favorites because it\u2019s easy to buy, easy to use in recipes and salads and is delicious. baby spinach or fully grown spinach are nutritional powerhouses and are incredibly alkaline. as with all green foods, spinach is rich in chlorophyll (see more about the health benefits of chlorophyll here), a potent alkalizer and red blood cell builder. it is also super high in vitamin k, vitamin a, manganese, folate, magnesium, iron, vitamin c, vitamin b2, calcium, potassium, vitamin e, dietary fiber\u2026i doubt there is a more all round healthy food on earth and i highly encourage you to eat spinach throughout the day, every day. add spinach to your favorite green juice or soup. 2. kale -kale is another leafy green beauty that is widely known for its cancer-fighting, cholesterol-lowering, antioxidant-rich, and detoxifying goodness. less popular than spinach, but only because it has a history of being cooked poorly (like cabbage) \u2013 when done right it is absolutely delicious. if you eat kale 2-3 times per week you will decrease dietary and metabolic acids. like spinach it is massively high in vitamin k, vitamin a and vitamin c and being leafy green it also has a huge chlorophyll content for building and improving red blood cell hemoglobin and hematocrit. the reason it is so powerful against acids that cause cancer is that kale contains at least four anti-acid or acid-buffering glucosinolates. glucosinolates are converted by the body into alkalizing acid-buffering compounds that protects the body cells from metabolic and dietary acids that are the cause of all sickness and disease. also, kale is quite amazing for lowering cholesterol because it will ower metabolic and dietary acids that causes the release of cholesterol. it should be noted that steamed kale is more effective for lowering metabolic and dietary acids and thus cholesterol lowering than raw. 3. cucumber - the beauty of cucumber is it\u2019s water content \u2013 95%. that is phenomenal and you won\u2019t find that in any other fruit. it\u2019s the grand daddy of alkaline water-content. this of course makes it an incredibly hydrating food to consume, that also contains superb amounts of antioxidants, including the super-important lignans. these highly beneficial polyphenols have more commonly been associated with the cruciferous vegetables, but their content in other veggies such as cucumbers is gaining more and more attention. cucumbers contain a right load of lariciresinol, pinoresinol, and secoisolariciresinol , three lignans that have a huge and very strong history of research in connection with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease as well as several cancerous types, including breast, uterine, ovarian, and prostate cancerous conditions. the best thing about cucumber is that they provide the base for practically every alkaline soup, smoothie and juice \u2013 giving you a very alkaline, very nutritious base that also tastes great. in terms of the actual nutrient rda per serving, cucumbers contain fair amounts of vitamins k and c, and slightly less of vitamin a and the b vitamins. cucumbers also contain the following alkaline minerals: calcium, iron, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc. 4. broccoli - broccoli is just a must. if you are serious about living with health, energy and vitality you simply have to eat broccoli, if not on a daily basis, then at least 4 times per week. broccoli has been proven over and over and over again to be incredibly powerful in inhibiting the acids that cause cancerous conditions. broccoli supports the digestive system, the cardiovascular system, the detoxification processes in the body and also supporting the skin, metabolism, immune system, being a wonderful anti-inflammatory and providing ample acid chelating antioxidants. eaten steamed or raw its a hugely alkaline and a hugely nutritious food. please, please, please eat lots and lots of it. put it in salads, juices, smoothies, soups\u2026steam it with other green veggies \u2013 you can even roast. 5. avocado -i eat a lot of avocado because we grow them here at the rancho del sol. not a salad, smoothie or soup goes by without me adding at least one avocado. i probably eat at least seven to ten avocados per week. now, i know a lot of people give avocado a bad rap because it is a high-fat food (85% of it\u2019s calories come from fats) \u2013 but this is totally good fat. these are good fats that will not make you gain weight. if anything, due to the high content of oleic acid (making it an omega 9 fat and very similar to olive oil), it can lower total cholesterol level and raise levels of high-density lipoproteins (hdls) while lowering low-density lipoproteins (ldls), also known as the cholesterol that chelates metabolic and/or metabolic acid. oleic fat also slows the development of heart disease, and promotes the production of acid chelating antioxidants. these beneficial omega oils also help speed the metabolism, actually leading to weight loss rather than gain. so now we\u2019re over the fat issue, avocado also contains a wide range of other nutrients that have serious anti-inflammatory, heart health, cardiovascular health, anti-cancer, and will lower naturally blood sugar acid. containing key antioxidants such as alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, selenium and more \u2013 it is a powerful, alkaline, nutrient-dense superfood. the most powerful anti-acid is the antioxidant luctein which has been shown to prevent and reverse prostate cancer. 6. celery - celery, like cucumber is a favorite because it\u2019s alkaline and really high water content, so is used very frequently as a base in juices and soups. one of celery\u2019s big benefits is it\u2019s vitamin c level, which has the well known benefits \u2013 but two of it\u2019s lesser known nutrients are phthalides which have been shown to lower cholesterol and coumarins which have been shown to inhibit several cancerous conditions. the beauty of vitamin c rich foods are that they help with the most common and most challenging health concerns \u2013 they support the immune system, inflammation (so helps with arthritis, osteoporosis, asthma etc), and vitamin c also helps significantly with cardiovascular health. if you are on a weight loss journey, you\u2019ll also be happy to hear that this alkaline staple contains plenty of potassium and sodium and so is a diuretic \u2013 meaning it helps rid the body of excess acidic fluids. because celery is a great source of sodium, this vegetable helps to maintain the alkaline design of the body. the high sodium levels in celery helps to transport energy ions in the form of electrons and is fundamental in the production of sodium bicarbonate. 7. capsicum / bell pepper / pepper - the antioxidant superpower, bell pepper is one of my all-time-favourites because it is crunchy and refreshingly delicious. you can use it in almost any meal raw, steamed or lightly roasted and it is always a winner. impressively beneficial to our health cartenoids are highly researched and get a lot of attention in the health field and bell peppers contain over 30 different members of the carotenoid nutrient family. the only other food that is close to this is the tomato. bell peppers have shown up in research relating to decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, type ii diabetes, macular degeneration, cancer, inflammation and more. alongside these lesser known or more complex-named antioxidants, bell pepper is one of, if not the best food source of the more common antioxidants: vitamin c, vitamin a and vitamin e. in fact, bell peppers contain twice as much vitamin c as oranges without all the acidic sugar. here are just some of the antioxidants bell pepper contains: - flavonoids \u2013 luteolin \u2013 quercetin \u2013 hesperidin - carotenoids \u2013 alpha-carotene \u2013 beta-carotene \u2013 cryptoxanthin \u2013 lutein \u2013 zeaxanthin - hydroxycinnamic acid - ferulic acid \u2013 cinnamic acid.

moved away from home to school with big plans by day, studied the history of music by night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance to get your pants was a mission impo\u2013ssible we were both the same age, but i suppose wasn't on the same page, but in the same book of life, so i'd page you when i felt you that were getting off of work or either when you're on your way to school we started hanging like ernie and bert and in my idle head i'm thinking, \"cool\" just when i think i'm going down your shirt you're hiking up your skirt now the events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be heaven or hell the angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best therefore hard to tell you'd dropped me off by the dungeon never came in, but i knew that you were wondering \"now are these niggas in this house up to something selling crack sack by sacks so they could function?\" w-w-w-well, yes and no yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow cook it in the basement then move it at a show then grab the microphone and everybody yelled, \"ho!\" meanwhile, the video starts playing bet, college radio, and a van packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand and one in their ear, you know what i'm saying but, i kept your number in my old phone got a new chip flip with the roam-roam so it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits but i promised i would call you when i got home but, when i got home, i never did by the time i did, heard that you had a kid by some nigga in decatur who replied, \"see you later\" when he got the good news; that's life, shit now, i'm nineteen with a cadillac my nigga had a lex with the gold pack got a plaque, but i'm living with my pop-pop so i got a glock and a lojack you kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw and never said much 'cause half of what he saw was so far from that place you wanna be that words only fucked it up more, follow me are you starting to gather what i'm getting at? now if i'm losing you, tell me, then i'll double back but keep in mind, at the time \"keep it real\" was the phrase silly once said now, but those were the days when spring break, and daytona, and freakniks made you wanna drop out of college and never go back move to the south, but that ain't a kodak moment, on went myself and big boi well, you knew him as 'twan that's right, you were around before this shit begun when 'twan had a daughter and sorta was made to mature before the first tour we hit the road like jack laughed and cried and drive it back with some yak girls used to say, \"y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?\" and i'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling \"no, i'm from atlanta, baby, he from savannah, maybe we should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey, we gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes\" she's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants 15-love, fit like glove description is like fifteen doves in a jacuzzi catching the holy ghost making one woozy in the head and comatose, agree? enough about me, how's about you? how's the lil' kid? she was about two the last time we spoke i hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink 'cause i'd start the second album off on another note now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off but see, i'd balled out, and 'fore i'd fall out i'd slow my lac down to a nice speed the brain was that fried egg i might need new direction was apparent i was a child looking at the floor, staring so changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast yes, i was on the rise, yeast was the street to make bread, never primary concern just to hop on these beats and wait my turn i'd meet muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas and macaroni niggas, imposters so on a trip to new york on some beeswax i get invited to a club where emcees at and on stage is a singer with some thing on her head similar to the turban that i covered up my dreads with which i was rocking at the time when i was going through them phases trying to find anything that seemed real in the world still searching, but i started liking this girl now you know her as erykah \"on and on\" badu call tyrone on the phone, \"why you do that girl like that, boy? you ought to be ashamed\" the song wasn't about me and that ain't my name we're young, in love, in short we had fun no regrets, no abortion, had a son by the name of seven, and he's five by the time i do this mix, he'll probably be six you do the arithmetic, me do the language arts y'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts to poke you in the heart and take you from the start to when luxury transportation meant a marta card or either when your girlfriend that went to mays mama or her daddy let her borrow the benz, because she's smart or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor and he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard you fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump you give it all your time because that's all you can think about and that's as far as i got (*music fades*) and that's as far as i got, and where i wanted to go knowing the whole summer that's all you could think about even though if you cut it off and start that bitch up you need a jump, like your need and your want to grow and you change all the time so that rabbit that you thought about that whole summer the next summer, you didn't want that rabbit no more you wanted something bigger and better \"so the summer passed and now the rabbit's old?\" right... right, so now you want a cadillac...
